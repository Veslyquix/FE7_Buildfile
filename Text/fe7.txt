[OpenMidRight][N]
We're all weaklings compared[N]

We've been sparring once every[N]

Ah... It's nothing. Just,[.][N]

[OpenMidLeft][N]
There was this man--a giant with a[N]
great beard--carrying a girl[A][N]
on his shoulders.[.][A][0x02][N]
The girl called to him "Father,"[.....][N]
and she was smiling, happy.[.][A][N]
Then the father said to her,[N]
"Yes, my beloved daughter?"[.][A][0x02][N]
That's all, really. [A][N]
But it felt as though...[.....][N]
It felt like a long-past memory.[A][0x02][.....][N]
The man looked a bit like my[N]
own father, I suppose.[A][N]
But who is the little girl?[.][N]
Aye, she was a cute one.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
What color was her hair?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Huh. Blue.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
And the man's hair? His moustache?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
His were bluish, too.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][N]
Then it is a vision of[N]

A great moustache, eh?[.....][N]
Ah hah hah![.][A][N]

Grr... You laughed![.][A][N]
Hm. If that is my future[N]
I'm not sure I like it.[.][A][N]

[OpenMidLeft][N]
The girl that would be my daughter...[.][A][N]
She gets taken away by this[.][N]

...A boy with red hair![.][N]
Yes, it was red, I'm sure of it.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Don't get ahead of yourself![A][N]
There are plenty of people[N]
with red hair...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]

the boy was a Pheraen.[A][N]
No matter how close we may be,[N]
I'll not--I'll not give up my daughter![.][A][ClearFace][N]

Hector, you still remember that time?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
What time?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
You know, what was it--[.][N]
ten years ago?[A][0x02][N]
When the lords of Lycia held the[N]
oath rites, back in Ostia?[A][N]
"Should one land of Lycia be[N]
attacked, all will fight as one..."[.][A][N]
Remember? While our parents[.][A][N]
were off pledging their oaths, we[.][N]
kids were in that one room.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Yeah, I remember.[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
We had to act in a manner befitting[.][N]
the children of nobility, or some such[A][N]
nonsense. I just remember being stuck[.][A][N]
in there, having to sit in that chair[.][N]
talking to whoever was next to me.[A][0x02][ToggleSmile][N]
Course, wouldn't you know that[N]
Erik of Laus was on my right?[.][A][N]
Man, I heard more than enough[.][N]
sweet talk from that one![.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Right, right. That was the first[N]
time any of us met, after all.[A][N]
He had no idea who you were--[.][A][N]
he just wanted to get in favor[N]
with a lordling of Lycia.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][N]
Aye, he was all mouth[.][N]
anyway.[.][A][N]
Saying things like "let us join forces[N]
for the good of Lycia," and such...[.][A][N]
then running when[.][N]
things turned sour.[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Aw, don't be too hard on him.[.][A][N]
When he jumped up, yelling[N]
about us swearing our own oaths,[A][N]
then cut his hand like that...[A][N]
No one else knew what to do, either.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Well, everyone's heard the stories.[.][N]
They all know it's the warriors' custom.[A][0x02][N]
Each cuts his own hand, then shakes[.][N]
hands with his brothers...[A][N]
What man wouldn't want to do that?[A][N]
Only one had the guts to meet him, though.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
...You know, back then,[.][N]
I'm proud I took your hand.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][......][N]
We are friends, sharing[.][N]
a life-dream now, an ambition.[A][N]
When one is in danger, the[N]
other risks his life to protect him...[A][0x02][N]
That's why you came, isn't it?[N]
Because you remembered?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Heh. I've got no plans to break[.][N]
my oath. Not now, not ever.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Likewise.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Well, then let's live long and in health![.][A][N]
I don't want to hear any excuses about not[N]
being able to come help when we're old men.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
It's a deal.[.....][N]
...Stay alive, Hector.[A][N]

either. I'd never forgive you.[A][X]

My father taught me the basics.[.][A][N]
Then, I received some instruction[.][N]
from Marcus.[A][N]
I spar once every two months[N]
with Hector, too.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]

I don't know any ladies[.][N]

Most of them never leave[N]

are at the banquets and such.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Banquets...[.][.....][N]
I see.[A][N]
Those are no place for someone[N]
from the plains, like me.[.][A][N]
Oh well...[A][0x02][N]
Chancellor Reissmann tells me[.][N]
I need to learn manners.[A][N]
I have to attend all these affairs[N]

That's rare in Lycia.[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Yes, as children we decided that[N]

other than the mercenary way.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
I see.[A][N]
My father once told me[N]
of your homeland, long ago.[.][A][N]
The ground of Ilia is covered year-[.][N]
round in the whitest snow, he said,[.][A][N]
and it is a harsh life for[N]
the people who live there.[A][N]
Yet because many Ilians turn[N]
to being mercenaries,[.][A][N]
they are looked down upon--[.][N]
without reason--by other lands.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Yes...[A][N]
But there is nothing to[.][N]
be done about it.[.][A][N]
No matter how many tears[N]

Hmm, what's that?[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][N]
You have forgotten...[.][......][N]
That is too bad.[A][0x02][N]
When I was young...[.][A][N]
When I was with you[.][N]
in Cornwell...[A][N]
You made a promise[N]
to me, brother. You said:[.][A][N]
When I grew larger, you'd[.][N]
take me as your bride.[A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Yes, but, surely...[.][A][N]
Priscilla...?[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][N]
Yes, I know.[.....][N]
It was a child's game.[A][N]
So you said to me as [.][N]
I cried and cried...[A][N]
And then you gave[.][N]
me this ring.[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
And...And you still...[A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][N]
I am still a child --[.][A][N]
So allow me one more[N]

Please, let me stand[N]

Don't make me suffer[N]

What...?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
I planned to get revenge on Ostia for[.][N]
the destruction of House Cornwell.[A][N]
Since I cast aside the name Raymond[.][N]

revenge is all I have lived for.[A][0x02][N]

We Ostian knights are[.][N]
the strongest in the realm.[.][A][N]
We are the true reason that[.][N]
Castle Ostia is said to be impregnable![.][A][N]
We may not be fleet of foot, but[N]
we will best any man on the field![A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
I hear what you are saying,[.][N]

Knights must be of noble blood,[.][N]
must they not?[A][N]

Rubbish, my good man.[.][A][N]
Even I am a commoner by birth.[A][ToggleSmile][N]

Rich or poor.[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleMouthMove][N]
......[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Is this true?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][N]
Yes, but only the best[N]
soldiers become knights.[A][N]
And the training is long[N]
and hard indeed.[A][0x02][N]
But you seem to be[N]
sound of spirit as well.[A][N]
Why, it's as if you were[N]
born to become a knight![A][ToggleSmile][N]

my proposition?[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Oswin...[A][N]
Why did you...[N]
become a knight?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][N]
Why, to protect good Ostia[N]
in this armor, of course![.][A][N]
This cold steel protects[N]
not only my body, you know.[.][A][N]
It also protects my[.][N]
lord and my people![.][A][N]
I became a knight to act as the[.][N]
very wall that protects our families.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
I see...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
And so...[.][A][N]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][N]
No...[.][A][N]
Forgive me, but[.][N]
I must decline.[.][A][N]
I respect your choice in life.[A][N]
But I fight to protect only[.][N]
one, not many.[A][0x02][N]

I understand...[.][A][N]
You are her knight then,[N]
my good man.[A][N]
That is our loss, but the[.][N]
choice you make is solid.[.][A][0x02][N]
Well then, shall we be going?[.][A][N]

Only work and survival matter.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][N]
Maybe so.[.][.....][N]
Yeah, maybe you're right.[.][A][0x02][N]
I was born into a rich family,[N]

Most boats use wind[.][N]

You can move quickly with the wind,[.][N]

And that's...[.][A][N]

Yes, my father used his profits[.][N]
to hire many rowers.[A][N]
They spent their days in the[N]
stifling hold of the ship,[A][N]
slaving like beasts.[A][N]
When they collapsed with exhaustion,[N]
my father just tossed them overboard.[.][A][N]

But one day, I ventured[.][N]

When they were divested[.][N]

my mother and father...[.][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
But...I wanted to ask[.][N]
my father one thing.[A][N]
Why...did he...[.][N]
have to steal?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
My lord, Uther of Ostia, [.][N]
investigated the matter.[A][N]
He...entrusted me...[N]
with some details.[A][N]
In recent years, the Cornwell[.][N]
fortune had begun to decline.[.][A][0x02][N]
Marquess Cornwell,[N]
in acts of kindness,[A][N]
had assumed the debts[.][N]
of many close to him.[.][A][N]
When he could not pay his own[.][N]
debts, the wolves came out.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
But...if it was a matter[N]
of money, why couldn't[A][N]
they ask my adopted family,[.][A][N]
the Caerleons?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
The amount they stole was...[N]
far greater than they owed.[.][A][N]
Your parents did not want to[N]
involve the daughter they[.][A][N]
had sent away.[A][N]

There is no need[A][N]
to stay at my side...[.][.....][N]
away from your charge...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][OpenEyes][N]
Lord Hector...[N]
gave me leave to come.[A][0x02][N]
I must express my regret[N]
for what our Ostia has done[.][A][N]
to House Cornwell.[A][N]
The marquess did[N]
commit a grave crime.[.][A][N]
But the vilest sin was[A][N]
the issue of the order...[.][.....][N]
that caused so much grief.[A][0x02][N]
If he had stayed alive,[.][A][N]
perhaps much calamity[.][N]
could have been avoided.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
...No matter what we say,[.][.....][N]
the dead will not return...[.][A][0x02][N]
But as long as I will live,[.][A][N]
I will remember that you...[.][A][N]
that Ostia...[.][.....][N]

Last time I saw him[.][N]

Fargus pulled into port at Badon,[.][A][N]
and a young man had[.][N]
collapsed on the pier...[A][N]
He was bleeding pretty badly...[.][N]
They say it was a miracle he lived at all.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
What!![A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Everyone in town just[.][N]
pretended not to notice...[A][N]
And no wonder...[.....] That day was[.][N]
a holy day for Elimine's flock.[.][A][N]
They were forbidden any[.][N]
contact with blood...[.][A][0x02][N]
And the sailors... Well, you know[.][N]
how superstitious they are...[.][A][N]
That man lay there,[.][N]
half alive, for six hours...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
That's terrible...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Then the taboo lifted,[A][N]
and someone picked him up,[N]
just in time...[.][A][0x02][N]
...It was the leader of the[.][N]
pirates that work out of Badon.[.][A][N]
Well, that young man recovered,[.][A][N]
but as if in exchange for his life,[.][N]
he had lost all of his memories...[A][N]

There's...someone[.][N]

...Rebecca,[.][.....] manners and carriage[.][N]
alone do not make one a lady.[.][A][N]
Certainly, I had to learn[.][N]
the ways of the court...[A][N]
But my husband,[.][.....] Lord Pent,[.][N]
did not marry me for those.[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenRight][N]
Do you mean that?[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][N]
Haha...[.][.....] I do! I was 14...[A][N]

Count Reglay had gathered as[N]
many as 20 women to consider...[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenRight][N]
Twenty women!?[A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][N]
Before Lord Pent would see them,[N]
each had to exhibit a special skill.[A][N]
Everyone was eager to demonstrate[.][N]
the qualities of a good wife...[.][A][N]
And...[.....]I was one of those women[N]
trying so hard to impress him.[A][N]
They were all highborn[N]
ladies of Etruria.[A][N]
They sang, danced, played music,[N]
and composed poetry...[A][N]
And I could not have outdone[N]
them in any of those arts...[A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenRight][N]
So...then...how did he come[.][N]
to choose you?[A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][N]
...I said to Lord Pent,[.][N]
"My skill is with the bow."[.][A][N]
And then...[.][A][N]
"My sweet lord, if you choose me,[.][N]
I will protect you to life's end."[A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenRight][N]
No...way![.][A][N]

My face was flushed after I spoke,[A][N]
and the room filled with laughter.[A][N]

as if to say "foolish girl!"[A][N]
But one of them...smiled.[.][A][N]

It was...Lord Pent.[.][A][N]

I was born as the youngest[N]

I wanted to become a knight[.][N]
from my earliest childhood,[.][A][N]
so I spent many long,[.][N]
bitter hours in training...[.][A][N]
I hoped to someday protect[N]

But...[A][N]
There was one thing for[.][N]
which I was not prepared...[.][A][N]
To protect, one must do battle[N]

And to do battle with one's enemies,[N]
one must...strike...those enemies.[A][N]

I have fought all this[N]
time as a brave knight.[.][A][N]

And do you regret this choice?[A][N]

It would be...to let yourself be lost.[A][N]

"morph" appears even in[.][A][N]

Are they mentioned in the[.][N]
Eliminean scripture?[A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
A long time ago, I...[.][A][N]
Enough.[.][N]
I don't want to talk about this.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Oh. Well that is...[.][N]
truly unfortunate.[A][0x02][N]
You see, we know so[.][N]
little of Nergal.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Why, for example, did[.][N]
he begin creating morphs?[.][A][N]
After his falling out with the[N]
Archsage Athos, did he feel[.][A][N]
alone in the world?[.][A][N]
Did he need the company of[N]
someone who could understand him?[.][A][N]
Was he forced to...create[.][N]
...such a being?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
...Not exactly.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Oh?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
He has no care[N]
for his creations...[A][N]
He merely brought them[N]
into this world to serve him.[.][A][N]
His only interest is himself.[.][A][N]
Those...things...that[.][N]
he discards...[A][N]
They lose their way...[N]
and wander.[.][A][N]
And he cares not.[.][A][N]
Morphs...are the mere[.][N]
fact of existence...[A][N]
once meaning has[N]
been stripped away.[.][A][N]

morphs centuries ago.[.][A][N]

So...how could you...?[A][N]

Ah, Renault![.....][N]

[OpenMidLeft][N]
What is it?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Now, I ask you this, only[.][N]
for the sake of knowledge...[A][N]
Knowledge...is the[N]
reason for my journey...[A][N]
I understand there are some[.][N]
things you would rather[.][A][N]
the others did not know...[A][0x02][N]
So, please do not answer[N]
if you do not wish to.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
As you wish.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Please tell me...[.][A][N]
These morphs Nergal has created...[A][N]
How can you know so much about[N]
beings that are centuries old?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
I will give you the answer[N]
I suspect may be true.[A][N]
You know, because[.][N]
you were there.[.][A][N]
Nergal was alone after[N]
he and Athos separated.[.][A][N]
The only ones around[N]
him were his morphs...[A][CloseSpeechFast][N]
Perhaps then,[.][N]
you are...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][N]
What?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
...I have never thought one[.][N]
should back away from knowledge,[A][N]
but...I hesitate to ask...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Is that so...[.][A][N]
Then I will ask you a question.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Yes?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
You asked me before...[A][N]
Whether or not morphs had a soul...[.][A][N]
What do you think?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
Before...I would have said[N]
that I do not know...[.][A][0x02][N]
But now, perhaps I do...[N]
Morphs...do have souls...[.][A][N]
That is what I believe...[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
...That is not a bad answer.[A][0x02][N]
Your reply deserves[.][N]
another good answer...[A][N]
When Nergal first created[.][N]
his morphs, he was not alone.[.][A][N]
He had one assistant.[.][A][0x02][N]
A mercenary who wanted[N]
desperately to bring back[.][A][N]
a friend he had lost in battle.[.][A][N]
This mercenary volunteered[N]
freely for Nergal's experiments,[A][0x02][N]
knowing they would make him[.][N]
less than human...[A][N]

When I first met you,[.][A][N]
it was after you had[N]
come with Moth--[A][N]
I mean, with Sonia[N]
and the Black Fang.[.][A][N]
So I thought at first that[N]
you were with the Black Fang.[.][A][0x02][N]
Then, my brothers told me[.][N]
that you had come with Nergal.[A][N]
I had never met Nergal, but...[A][N]
As Nergal's servants,[.][A][N]
you and Sonia must have[.][N]
been friends, right?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was selected[N]
by Nergal as a child.[.][A][N]
He raised me to become[N]
his Angel of Death.[.][A][N]
...I...did not think.[.][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I did not feel.[.][A][N]
I did what I was told...[N]
...and that was all.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
I entered the Black Fang[N]
with the intent of infiltrating[.][A][N]
them, of using them...[A][N]
I had heard rumors about Sonia[N]
and her daughter being there...[.][A][0x02][N]
That child, raised by Sonia...[A][N]

something like myself...[A][0x02][N]

One day I just collapsed.[.][A][N]
I really worried my[.][N]

[OpenMidLeft][N]
Yeah?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
And that was when my teacher[N]
bought me this picture book...[A][CloseSpeechSlow][......][N]
He said, "Look, Erk, this book[N]
is filled with pictures. [.][A][N]
There are fields of rolling,[N]
green grass, flowers that[.][A][N]
explode into color, and[.][N]
clouds that crawl across[A][N]
the seamless sky. Training to[.][N]
be a mage requires more than[A][N]
staying in your room studying[.][N]
all the time. You must go[.][A][N]
outside and commune with the[N]
spirits. When you get better, [A][N]
we'll go for walks everyday.[N]
Until then, look at these[.][A][N]
pictures and think[N]
of how it will be." [A][CloseSpeechSlow][......][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Commune with the spirits...[.][N]
I do that a lot.[A][N]
My mother just used them,[.][.....][N]
and always said that[A][N]
talking to them was[.][N]
a waste of time, but...[.][A][CloseSpeechFast][N]
But it sounds like your teacher[.][N]
really got to know them.[A][N]
Eheheh.[.][.....] This makes[.][N]
me so happy...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
...You never cease to[.][N]
amaze me, Nino.[.][A][N]

Afternoon, Lord Pent![.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Here is the book I borrowed.[.....][N]
It was truly fascinating![.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
I am glad it pleased you.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
I have collected a great number[.][N]

and I thought I had read them all...[A][N]
But to find one of such high[N]
quality that I did not know of...[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
...I do believe this is the last[N]
surviving copy of this book.[A][N]
...As I told you before...[A][N]
Knowledge of the ancient magics[.][N]
has been passed down in[.][A][N]
our family for generations...[.][A][N]
Even this book...was to be[N]
passed to one of my three brothers.[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
And all three are now dead!![A][N]
Good Lord, man, you must be...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Oh, no! They are alive![.][A][N]
But...barely.[.][.....][N]
They merely subsist...[A][0x02][.....][N]
As you know, elder magic is[.][N]
based on the forces of darkness...[A][N]
It is even more powerful than nature[N]
magic, which is often called anima.[.][A][N]
But to use this magic, you must[.][N]
invite the dark forces within you.[A][N]
The temptation to submit to[.][N]
the darkness is...great.[A][N]
...Unfortunately, the[.][N]
darkness took my brothers...[A][N]
They live...and breathe...[.....][N]
their eyes open and close...[A][N]
But...they do not move.[.][.....][N]
And they do not speak.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]

There is no guarantee that[N]

However,[.....] I must see the other side.[.][N]

[OpenMidRight][N]
This is the course of knowledge.[.....][N]

[OpenMidRight][N]
I cannot do that.[.][A][N]
It is an important part[.][N]
of your family history![.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][ToggleSmile][N]
Yes, but it was written[.][N]
by my mother.[.][A][N]
If I ask her, she[.][N]

[OpenMidRight][N]
...Unbelievable.[.....][N]

this book was written[.][N]
by someone still alive!?[A][N]

[OpenLeft][N]
Her name is Niime.[N]
She is an odd character.[A][N]
She is known to some[N]

We've learned quite a bit[.][N]
on this quest, haven't we?[A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
I suppose.[A][N]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][N]
You suppose?[A][N]
Why, when we get back to Caelin,[N]

Don't start with[N]

This is no time for gaiety.[.][A][N]

fighting ahead of us.[.][A][N]

You always expect the worst.[.....][N]
That's why Lady Lyndis never...[.][A][N]

Hold your tongue. I'll have[.][N]
none of your foolishness now![.][A][N]
Just keep your wits about you,[N]
that's all I'm saying.[A][N]

Who's overconfident?[A][N]

Yes, the same thought has[.][N]
occurred to me.[.][A][N]
As a hired lance, I thought[.][N]
it not my place to speak.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Camaraderie in the field[N]

A problem indeed.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
I have decided to seek the counsel[N]

Perhaps she could issue some[N]
order limiting...interactions[.][A][N]

That is a good idea.[A][N]
It would be the best way to[.][N]

need to iron out the[N]

I hope you would not mind[.][N]
lending me your assistance...[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Oh, but of course.[A][N]
It might be difficult to find time[N]
to discuss this on the battlefield.[.][A][N]
Perhaps later, when we can be alone...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Yes, of course.[.][A][N]
I would be truly grateful[.][N]
to have the company of[A][N]

Where have you traveled[.][N]

We didn't know where you had gone,[N]

[OpenMidLeft][N]
Hm? Oh, er... Yes, well...[.....][N]
I just...wandered about.[A][N]
I felt that I had lost some[.][N]

a remarkable person.[A][N]

I had not seen her in a long time...[A][N]
But she looks more like[.][N]
Lady Madelyn every day...[.][A][N]

When Lady Lyndis's parents eloped,[A][N]
I heard that Lord Hausen[N]
became terribly angry...[A][N]

Yes.[.....][N]
He was usually warm and kind,[.][N]
but his demeanor changed[A][N]
entirely when it came to[N]
Lady Madelyn's welfare.[.][A][N]
I was ordered to bring[N]
them both back.[.][A][N]
I was told to resort to force[.][N]
against Hassar if he resisted.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
That is quite a shock...[A][N]
I cannot imagine such an order[N]
from our kind lord now...[.][A][N]

But I could not take them.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Why is that?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]

Do not harm the other."[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][N]
......[A][ToggleMouthMove][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
In the end, I closed my eyes[N]

I told the marquess that[N]
they eluded me.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
You disobeyed an order[N]
from your liege?![.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
...Yes, and I spent six months[N]
in the dungeon for it...[A][N]
Considering his anger at the time,[N]
he was probably being[.][A][N]
lenient with me.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
But why did you do it?[A][N]
I can certainly understand[N]
it must have been a[.][A][N]
hard order to follow, but...[A][N]
to disobey your lord is[.][N]
unthinkable for a knight...[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
So it is.[.][A][N]
But what would you have done?[.][A][N]
Would you have dragged Lady[.][N]
Madelyn back to the castle,[.][A][N]
ending their chance for love?[.][A][N]
She might have taken her own[N]
life if faced with such grief.[A][N]
And Lady Lyndis would[.][N]
never have been born...[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
No...[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
When the marquess fell ill last year,[.][N]
Lundgren seized power in Caelin.[A][N]
What would you have done then?[A][N]
Would you have served Lundgren[N]
because you had sworn fealty to Caelin?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][N]
......[A][ToggleMouthMove][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
For knights in the service of a lord,[.][N]
an order is absolute.[.][A][N]
But a knight does not follow[N]
orders blindly.[.][A][N]
Before obeying, a knight should[.][A][N]
always consider whether the[.][N]
order serves the lord who gives it.[.][A][X]

Lord Heath, please help[.][N]
me to understand.[.][A][N]
The wyvern riders of Bern[.][N]
are considered to be the[A][N]
strongest knights in the land.[A][N]
Surely we Lycian knights[N]
would fall to their lances[A][N]
if we met them head on...[.][A][N]
So why would you leave[N]
Bern for Lycia?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
...Bern is not as it once was.[A][N]
Our sovereign has imprisoned[A][N]
all those nobles who[N]
do not meet his favor.[A][N]
And their fabled power is[.][N]
a feeble joke.[A][N]
The only real strength[N]
of Bern's knights these[.][A][N]
days is in their boasting.[A][N]
And their general is good[.][A][N]
for nothing but wagging[.][N]
his tail at the king.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][N]
......[A][ToggleMouthMove][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
There was an uprising on our[N]
frontier, a rebellion of sorts.[.][A][N]
The knights were ordered to[.][N]
put it down and kill the rebels.[A][N]
Our commander went to scout[.][N]
out the enemy camp.[.][A][N]
This "uprising" was nothing more[N]
than a group of unarmed peasants.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
I see...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Then I heard the truth[N]
from our commander.[.][A][N]
One of our generals had[.][N]
drummed up a fake rebellion[.][A][N]
to enhance his military career.[.][A][N]
These people did not want to fight.[.][N]
They ran at the mere sight of us.[.][A][N]
Then, the famous wyvern riders[A][N]
of Bern rained savage death down[N]
upon these innocents.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove][N]
......[A][ToggleMouthMove][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
My unit tried to stop them.[.][A][N]
We were all condemned to[N]
die for our treason.[A][N]
However, our general spread the[.][N]
story that we were to be hanged[.][A][N]
for slaughtering innocent lives.[A][N]
Before they could round us up, we[.][N]
decided to turn our coats and run.[A][N]
One of us stayed behind as a decoy,[.][N]
and the rest fled for the border.[.][A][N]
After that, we dispersed. All have[N]
been killed now, except for me.[.][A][0x02][N]
Are you satisfied now?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
...I see.[.][.....][N]
So, Bern...[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Bern is nothing to me...[A][N]
I have no love for a country[N]
that slaughters its own.[A][N]
Kent, what about your liege?[A][N]
Would you give your life[N]
in this lord's service?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile][N]
Yes.[A][N]
It is a knight's honor to swear[.][N]
his fealty and his life.[A][N]
My happiness is to serve.[.][A][X]

was an ice dragon in Ilia.[A][N]

the people of Ilia, who had[.][A][N]

But a war broke out between[.][N]
dragons and people...[.][A][N]

I braved the cold and waited all[N]

[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile][N]
Yes! Pegasi will only[.][N]

They're only really good for[N]
digging the stables out of[A][N]

you can worry about it[A][N]

Yes, I will probably die.[.][N]
Is that what you mean to say?[.][A][N]
But Prince Zephiel's life is[N]
worth the price.[A][N]

Hmm...[A][N]
One reason is self-interest.[A][N]
Whether I'm working in this army[N]

it makes sense to have a[N]

Of course, it does complicate[.][N]

I'm being hunted by my homeland.[N]
There's a price on my head.[.][A][N]
Being close to me isn't like[N]

[LoadOverworldFaces]The apprentice tactician [.][Tact][N]
and the young swordfighter Lyn.[.][A][N]
A strange pair on an even[.][N]
stranger journey.[.][A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]To prepare for the long road ahead,[.][A][N]
they go to Bulgar, the commercial[.][N]
center of Sacae.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Unbeknownst to Lyn, she will discover[.][N]
something that will alter her life forever.[.][A][X]

# 0x06BD
A small altar lies on the outskirts[.][N]
of Bulgar.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]This ancient temple, sacred to the people[.][N]
of Sacae, has long been known for[.][A][N]
its powerful bond to the world of spirits.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Before starting their journey, our travelers[N]
come here to pray for their well-being.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]At this altar, Lyn's hand is directed[.][N]
to a grand inheritance.[.][A][X]

# 0x06BE
[LoadOverworldFaces]The secrets of her past revealed in the[.][N]
words of two Knights of Lycia.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, to meet her grandfather, Lyn[.][N]
heads west,[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]to Lycia, and to her destiny.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A mountain range separates the Sacae[N]
Plains from Bern.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]There are many bandits lurking here,[N]
the cruelest of which are the Taliver.[A][N]
They wreak havoc on both Sacae and Bern,[N]
and their savagery knows no bounds.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]On her tenth day away from the plains,[A][N]
Lyn witnesses their atrocities herself.[.][A][X]

# 0x06BF
[LoadOverworldFaces]After defeating the bandits, Lyn[N]
continues westward.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]She and her colleagues stop for the[.][N]
night at a ruined fortress.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Ganelon bandits are in a rage after[.][N]
their brethren fell to Lyn's swords.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They race in pursuit of the companions.[.][A][N]
Their angry footsteps sound[.][N]
closer and closer...[A][X]

# 0x06C0
The next morning comes too quickly.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn has fought back the bandits' attack.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, she rushes for the border of Bern.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]If she can reach it, Lycia itself[.][N]
is not far off.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]For a moment, Lyn stops to imagine the[N]
face of a grandfather she's never seen.[.][A][X]

# 0x06C1
[LoadOverworldFaces]At long last, Lyn arrives in the land[.][N]
of her mother's birth.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lycia is a federation of territories, each[N]
one ruled by a powerful marquess.[.][A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, Lyn takes her leave of one of these[N]
territories, Araphen[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]and sets out to meet her grandfather, the[.][N]
marquess of Caelin.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, the marquess's brother, Lundgren,[N]
hungers to rule Caelin.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He is preparing a deadly welcome for Lyn,[.][N]
who stands to threaten his grasp for power.[.][A][X]

# 0x06C2
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn takes her leave of Araphen, finding[.][N]
no aid from its spiteful marquess.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, she and her companions resume[N]
their march toward Caelin in earnest.[.][A][N]
Racing against time, with her[.][N]
grandfather's life the prize.[.][A][N]
Harried and impatient, Lyn[N]
presses onward.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Suddenly a young boy appears[N]
and pleads for their assistance.[A][X]

# 0x06C3
[LoadOverworldFaces]A mysterious group seems hell-bent[N]
on capturing Nils and Ninian...[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Having failed, this group, the Black Fang,[N]
flees. Rumor has them traveling southwest.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn and her colleagues follow in hopes[N]
of recovering a lost heirloom.[A][N]
The Black Fang have made a stronghold[.][N]
of an abandoned castle in Khathelet.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Its dark halls are alive with shadowy[.][N]
figures...[A][X]

# 0x06C4
[LoadOverworldFaces]Passing through Araphen and Khathelet,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn and her friends arrive in Caelin.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, Caelin is now under the[N]
rule of Lord Lundgren.[A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lundgren's henchmen lay in wait[.][N]
to assassinate Lyn.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They wait for her approach and[N]
ready a special weapon.[.][A][X]

# 0x06C5
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn and her friends have been branded[.][N]
as traitors, pretenders to the throne.[A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lundgren has sent word to Caelin's[N]
neighbors, warning them of Lyn's approach.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He calls for reinforcements to put[N]
an end to the "imposters."[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]If the other realms of Lycia choose to[N]
act, Lyn will never reach Caelin alive.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn places her faith in Eliwood[.][N]
and waits.[A][X]

# 0x06C6
[LoadOverworldFaces]General Eagler has been defeated.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn and her band draw ever nearer[.][N]
to Castle Caelin.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Within the castle walls, Lyn's bitter[.][N]
enemy, Lundgren, awaits...[A][N]
A man who would kill his own[N]
kin for a throne.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He is the source of all her[.][N]
troubles. He must be stopped.[.][A][X]

# 0x06C7
Once, dragon fought man in[N]
a war called the Scouring...[A][N]
Mankind vanquished the dragons thanks[.][N]

The continent was divided into nations, and[.][N]
the people enjoyed an easy prosperity.[A][X]

How much longer can this peace stand[N]

# 0x06D0
[LoadOverworldFaces][X]

# 0x06D1
[LoadOverworldFaces]Deep within the Lycian League lies[N]
Pherae, a land that has known no conflict[.][A][N]
for many generations, but which now finds[.][N]
itself touched by a shadow of unease.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Its beloved and benevolent ruler, Lord[N]
Elbert, has mysteriously vanished...[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]as have a number of his sworn men,[N]
loyal knights who serve at his side.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A month has passed without word from[N]
the marquess.[.][......] Rumors of his death abound.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, the marquess's son believes his[N]
father lives,[.][......] and he has vowed to find him.[A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Marquess Pherae's son, Eliwood:[.][A][N]
A red-haired youth who will one day[.][N]
become the finest knight in all of Lycia.[.][A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]His long journey begins here.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D2
[LoadOverworldFaces]After speaking with the village magistrate,[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood and company set their[.][N]
sights on Laus.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The road from Pherae to Laus passes[.][N]
through Santaruz.[.][A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood suspects his missing father must[N]
have visited Santaruz en route to Ostia.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood arranges a meeting with the local[.][N]
ruling lord to see what he can learn.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D3
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood enters Santaruz, only to be[.][N]
attacked by a strange group.[A][N]
In a desperate moment, he is[N]
rescued by a childhood friend,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Marquess Ostia's younger[N]
brother, Hector.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The assailants' leader reveals that an[N]
unknown party seeks Eliwood's head...[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood cannot help but think this is[.][N]
related to his father's disappearance.[A][0x02][N]
In search of more traces of his[.][N]
father's footsteps,[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood sets out for the castle of[N]
Lord Helman, the marquess of Santaruz.[A][X]

# 0x06D4
[LoadOverworldFaces]The dying words of Lord Helman[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]stun Eliwood beyond belief.[.][A]
[N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]"Darin, the marquess of Laus,[.][N]
knows all..."[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Despite the pain it brings, Eliwood takes[.][N]
this newfound knowledge to heart[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]and sets out for Laus once again.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]On the way to Laus, he travels[N]
through a Caelin village.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood and his party decide[N]
to rest there for a night.[A][X]

# 0x06D5
[LoadOverworldFaces]A droll merchant named Merlinus[.][N]
now joins Eliwood's group.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With Merlinus in tow, they set out[N]
for Laus the following day.[.][A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Laus is located in the heart of Lycia,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]a territory ruled by the power-hungry[.][N]
marquess of Laus, Lord Darin.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Preparations for the war of which[.][N]

[LoadOverworldFaces]The disappearance of Eliwood's father,[N]

[LoadOverworldFaces]Do these all revolve around[.][N]
Lord Darin?[.][A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In Eliwood's heart,[.][......] the need for truth is[N]
drowned in fear...[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A fear of what that truth may hold.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D6
[LoadOverworldFaces]Laus is located in the heart of Lycia,[A][N]

[LoadOverworldFaces]A fear of what that truth may hold.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D7
[LoadOverworldFaces]In Laus, Erik tells Eliwood of a plan.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A plot to use Laus as starting ground[.][N]
in a rebellion against Ostia.[.][A][0x02][N]

[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood needs proof to believe[N]
these accusations, and so[.][A][N]
he and his allies pursue Darin,[.][N]
the fleeing marquess of Laus.[.][A][N]
Where that chase would lead,[N]
Eliwood could not have known.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D8
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood and colleagues defeat Bauker,[.][N]
one of Marquess Laus's lackeys.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They then press on toward Castle Caelin.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Yet inside the castle many Laus[.][N]
soldiers remain.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood and friends begin their assault on[N]
the castle to save Marquess Caelin.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D9
[LoadOverworldFaces]After speaking with the Ostian spy Leila,[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood realizes he must travel to Valor,[.][N]
the Dread Isle.[.][A]
[N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The small island, located south of Lycia,[.][N]
is said to be home to the Dragon's Gate.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Heading for the southern coast of Caelin,[.][N]
they seek passage in the port of Badon.[.][A][X]

# 0x06DA
[LoadOverworldFaces]Fargus's ship sails along smoothly.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]At last, they spot a fog-enshrouded[.][N]
isle on the horizon.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood's father is on the isle,[N]
as is the Dragon's Gate.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]As they draw closer to the isle,[A][N]
Eliwood no longer fears that his father[.][N]
might be one of the conspirators.[.][A][N]
As the moment of truth nears, Eliwood[.][N]
only prays that he is safe.[.][A][X]

[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood's father is on the isle,[N]
as is the Dragon's Gate.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]As they draw closer to the isle,[A][N]
Eliwood no longer fears that his father[.][N]
might be one of the conspirators.[.][A][N]
As the moment of truth nears, Eliwood[.][N]
only prays that he is safe.[.][A][X]

# 0x06DC
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood arrives on the shores of Valor[N]
with a new companion in his numbers,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]an enigmatic young girl named Ninian.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The majority of the island is covered[.][N]
in dense forest.[A][N]
Legend has it that no one has ever[N]
returned from those dark woods.[.][A][N]
A dense fog crawls over the party,[N]
engulfing them one by one...[A][N]
Cautiously, they move deeper into[.][N]
the trees.[A][X]

# 0x06DD
[LoadOverworldFaces]With Uhai's dying words still sounding[N]
in their ears,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]they venture deep into the forest's heart.[A][N]
Lyn moves in utmost silence, cautious[.][N]
not to alert any hidden enemy.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, following on her path,[.][......][N]
a new Black Fang shadow appears.[A][X]

# 0x06DE
[LoadOverworldFaces]Following Uhai's last words, Eliwood[N]
ventures toward the heart of the forest.[A][0x02][N]
He is greeted by an extraordinary sight.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A building unlike any he's ever seen.[.][N]
It was clearly not wrought by human hands...[A][N]
It is waiting...waiting for the masters[.][N]
who abandoned it centuries past.[A][N]
Massive beyond belief, these ancient[N]
ruins have nothing to do with humankind.[A][N]
Eliwood has arrived.[N]
He has found the Dragon's Gate.[.][A][X]

# 0x06DF
[LoadOverworldFaces]At last, Eliwood's long-awaited reunion[.][N]
with his father,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]as well as their painful farewell.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]After escaping the Dread Isle, they[.][N]
return to the port city of Badon.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood remains silent for the duration[.][N]
of their passage.[.][A][N]
He sits cradling his father's cold hand[.][N]
as if to warm him back to life.[.][A][X]

# 0x06E0
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood travels westward to meet with[.][N]
Uther, the marquess of Ostia.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They pass through Laus and[N]
continue through two more territories.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]After a time, they arrive at a fortress[.][N]
separating Thria and Ostia.[.][A][X]

# 0x06E1
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Nabata Desert[.][A][X]

# 0x06E2
[LoadOverworldFaces]A wasteland of scorching sun[N]
and frigid nights.[A][N]
It rejects human life.[A][N]
Any careless enough to enter its[N]
embrace is doomed to wander lost.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Uther, the marquess of Ostia,[.][N]
spoke of a living legend...[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Guided by his words, Eliwood[N]
heads straight into the desert.[.][A][X]

# 0x06E3
[LoadOverworldFaces]Heeding the archsage Athos's advice,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood sets out for Bern.[A][X]

# 0x06E4
[LoadOverworldFaces]Bern: the greatest military force[.][N]
on the continent.[.][A][X]

# 0x06E5
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Lycian League has always enjoyed[N]
close relations with the kingdom of Bern.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Recently, however, King Desmond has[.][N]
begun to flaunt his military strength.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lycian nobles can no longer move[N]
freely within Bern's borders.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood and his group enter the[.][N]
country in the guise of simple travelers.[.][A][X]

# 0x06E6
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Bern royal family is a pageant[N]
of power, love, and hate.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood finds himself embroiled[.][N]
in their troubles.[A][N]
He has been sent to recover the[.][N]
Bern family treasure: the Fire Emblem.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It has been stolen from the[.][N]
palace vault.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood enters the royal palace[.][N]
seeking clues.[A][X]

# 0x06E7
[LoadOverworldFaces]They follow the Black Fang[N]
due south.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Although the trail vanishes, Lyn uses her[.][N]
tracking skills, and the pursuit continues.[.][A][N]
The path leads up into Bern's[.][N]
impassable mountains.[.][A][N]
The peaks know no seasons, and the[N]
snow covers all in a bright blanket.[A][N]
In this land of blinding reflections,[.][N]
an ancient castle appears.[A][X]

# 0x06E8
[LoadOverworldFaces]Two assassins in the employ of[N]
the Black Fang move in.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They've been set loose in the palace[N]
to murder the crown prince, Zephiel.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood hurries to prevent them from[N]
fulfilling their contract.[A][X]

# 0x06E9
[LoadOverworldFaces]Jaffar and Nino,[N]
Black Fang assassins.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Befriended by Eliwood, they've now[N]
joined his group.[.][A][N]
That night...[.][A][X]

# 0x06EA
[LoadOverworldFaces]After receiving aid from[N]
Queen Hellene,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood rushes to the[.][N]
sealed shrine.[A][N]
The secret road they follow[.][N]
is known only to the royal family...[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They pass Bern's soldiers[.][N]
unnoticed and unhindered.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They approach the castle...[.][A][X]

# 0x06EB
[LoadOverworldFaces]A mountain cave on the outskirts[N]
of Ostia.[.][A][N]
Here, a sacred weapon lies waiting,[.][N]
the seal guarding it broken.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, to retrieve the weapon,[N]
one must pass a trial.[A][N]
A long, seemingly uncrossable[.][N]
distance...[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood must overcome the challenge[.][N]
with the help of his friends.[.][A][N]
Eliwood's true strength will soon[.][N]
be sorely tested.[.][A][X]

# 0x06EC
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ninian is dead.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, only Nergal's echoing[N]
laughter remains...[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]On Hector's advice, the[.][N]
group heads toward Ostia.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They are weary to the bone, and[.][N]
they need time to regroup.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ostia is the most heavily guarded[.][N]
fortress city in all of Lycia.[A][N]
No enemy should have been[.][N]
able to breach its walls.[.][A][X]

# 0x06ED
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood struggles to recover from[.][N]
Ninian's death and moves onward.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]His destination is the Dread Isle.[A][N]
An enemy waits there, one who[.][N]
must be defeated.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Nergal surrounds himself with his[.][N]
morphs and waits for Eliwood's arrival.[.][A][N]
The final battle draws near...[A][X]

# 0x06EE
[LoadOverworldFaces]A month has passed since word came[N]
of Marquess Pherae's disappearance.[.][A][N]
Rumors and speculation run rampant[N]
throughout Lycia.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The head of House Ostia, Lord[.][N]
Uther, takes no apparent interest.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The marquess's younger brother[N]
is considered odd by the populace.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He and Marquess Pherae's son,[.][N]
Eliwood, are fast friends.[A][N]
A hot-blooded youth, he cannot[N]
ignore his friend's plight.[.][A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Marquess Ostia's younger brother, Hector.[.][A][N]
He would one day be a courageous[N]
general, a steel warrior to be feared.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The path he chooses will test him to[N]
the limits of his strength.[.][A][X]

# 0x06EF
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector leaves Ostia.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He moves toward Santaruz to meet[N]
up with Eliwood as quickly as possible.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He encounters a mysterious group whose[N]
dark garb hide an even darker secret.[.][A][N]
Perhaps these same powers have [.][N]
turned their blades on Eliwood...[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector hurries south,[.][N]
praying for his friend's safety.[A][X]

# 0x06F0
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector rescues Eliwood,[.][A][N]
and the two friends are reunited.[.][A][0x02][N]

[LoadOverworldFaces]The paladin Marcus reveals news:[A][N]
Someone has called for Eliwood's death.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Pherae's problems must be connected[.][N]
to the attempt on Eliwood's life.[.][A][N]
Searching for more clues,[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector and friends depart for[.][N]
the castle of Marquess Santaruz.[A][X]

# 0x06F1
[LoadOverworldFaces]The dying words of Lord Helman, the[.][N]
marquess of Santaruz...[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]only serve to strengthen[N]
Hector's convictions.[.][A]
[N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]"Darin, the marquess of Laus,[.][N]
knows all..."[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]To ascertain the truth of what he's[.][N]
heard, Hector departs for Laus.[.][A][0x02][N]

To reach Laus from Santaruz,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector's group must pass through[N]
a village in Caelin.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They decide to rest there[.][N]
for the night.[A][X]

# 0x06F2
[LoadOverworldFaces]A droll merchant named Merlinus[.][N]
now joins Hector's group.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With Merlinus in tow, Hector sets[.][N]
out for Laus the following day.[.][A][0x02][N]

[LoadOverworldFaces]Laus is located in the heart of Lycia,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]a territory ruled by the power-hungry[.][N]
marquess of Laus, Lord Darin.[.][A]
[N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]According to information gathered[.][N]
by Ostia's network of spies,[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Darin was definitely involved[.][N]
in Marquess Pherae's disappearance.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Despite strong opposition, Hector[.][N]
is determined to uncover the truth.[.][A][X]

[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector and his companions[.][N]

[LoadOverworldFaces]and seize Castle Laus.[A][N]
After the battle, they rest in the[N]
castle and settle their affairs.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They diligently prepare for any[.][N]
possible counterattack.[.][A][N]
They should've spotted anyone[.][N]
attempting to approach the castle.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]And yet, somehow, they find themselves[N]
facing an unforeseen attack...[A][X]

[LoadOverworldFaces]After repelling the mercenary[.][N]

Hector prepares to mount a[N]

[LoadOverworldFaces]Lord Darin and his knights[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]are with the instigator of the[N]
rebellion, the enigmatic Ephidel.[.][A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector learns where the fugitives were[N]

However, their final destination still[N]

Shortly thereafter, he notices[N]
something...[A][0x02][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ninian has gone missing.[A][N]
[LoadOverworldFaces]There! Her pale figure vanishes into the[N]

Battle an enemy from the[N]
woods, and the enemy will[.][N]

# 0x086E
Furthermore, [.][ToggleRed]mounted units[.][ToggleRed][N]
have the unique ability to[N]
[ToggleRed]move again[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
Essentially, this allows[N]
cavalry to move the[.][N]
[ToggleRed]number of spaces[N]

range[.][ToggleRed] if they haven't[A][N]
done so already.[A][0x02][N]
However, the [.][ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed][N]

And now for these knights[.][N]

You were going to share[.][N]
your story with me?[.][A][X]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x2F][0x01][N]
Yes.[A][N]
We have ventured from Caelin,[.][N]
in Lycia, in search of someone.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Lycia... That's the country beyond[N]
the mountains in the southwest, isn't it?[.][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
Correct. We've come as messengers[.][N]
to the lady Madelyn, [.][.....]who eloped[A][N]
with a nomad some 19 years ago.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
[ToggleMouthMove]Madelyn?[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
Our lord the marquess of Caelin's[.][N]
only daughter.[A][N]
He was heartbroken his own[N]
daughter would abandon him so.[A][N]
Eventually, the marquess simply[.][N]
declared that he had no daughter.[.][A][X]

# 0x0877
[OpenLeft][N]
And then this year, we received[.][N]
a letter from Lady Madelyn.[.][A][CloseSpeechFast][N]
It said that she, her husband,[A][N]
and their daughter were living[N]
happily on the Sacae plains.[A][ToggleSmile][N]
The marquess was ecstatic to learn[N]
he had a granddaughter of 18 years.[.][A][N]
I remember the smile on his[.][N]
face when he announced[A][N]
that he'd suddenly become[.][N]
a grandfather.[A][0x02][N]
The granddaughter's name[N]
is Lyndis.[A][N]
This was also the name[N]
of the marquess's wife,[.][A][N]
who passed away[.][N]
at an early age.[A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Lyndis?[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
That she should bear this name[N]
thawed the marquess's heart.[A][0x02][N]
Now, his only wish is to meet his[.][N]
daughter's family at least once.[A][N]
This is why we're here.[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
We didn't know that Lady[N]
Madelyn died a few days after[.][A][N]
sending her letter...[.][A][CloseSpeechFast][N]
We only learned this shortly after[N]
we arrived here in Bulgar.[A][X]

# 0x0878
[OpenFarLeft][N]
But we also learned all was not lost.[.][N]
Her daughter yet lives.[.][A][N]
We heard that she was living[N]
alone on the plains...[A][0x02][N]
I... I knew it immediately.[.][N]
You are the lady Lyndis.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Why would you[.][N]
think that...[.][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
Your resemblance to your[N]
departed mother is remarkable.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
What? Did you know my mother?[.][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
I'm sorry to say I never[N]
met her directly, but[.][A][N]
I saw her portraits in Castle Caelin.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
To the rest of my tribe,[N]
I was always Lyn.[.][A][N]
But when I was with[.][N]
my parents...[.][A][N]
When it was just the three[N]
of us, I was Lyndis.[A][0x02][CloseEyes][N]
It's all so strange.[A][N]
I was all alone in the world,[.][N]
and now I have a [.][.....]grandfather.[A][.....][N]
Lyndis... I never thought I[.][N]
would hear that name again.[.][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]

[OpenMidRight][N]
[OpenEyes][.....][N]
Wait![.][A][N]
That bandit! He called me[.][N]
Lyndis, too![A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
What?[.][.....][N]
How could he have--[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
...He was a henchman of[.][N]
Lord Lundgren, wasn't he?[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Lundgren?[.][.....][N]
Who's that?[.][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
He's the marquess's younger brother.[A][N]
Everyone assumed the lady[.][N]
Madelyn was gone forever.[.][A][N]
This made Lord Lundgren[.][N]
heir to the marquess's title.[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
To be blunt, milady,[A][N]
your existence is an obstacle to[N]
your granduncle's ambitions.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
That's-- But I have no interest[.][N]
in inheriting any title![A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
Unfortunately, your granduncle is[.][N]
not the sort of man to believe that.[A][N]
I believe the attempts on your[N]
life will persist.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
What should I do?[.][A][X]

# 0x087A
[OpenFarLeft][N]
Accompany us to Caelin.[.][.....][N]
Continuing on this way is dangerous.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
I feel I have little choice.[.....][N]
I will go with you.[.][A][X]

# 0x087B
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1A][0x01][N]
[Tact]... I'm sorry.[N]
This changes everything.[A][N]
What will you do, [Tact]?[.][N]
You...want me to decide?[A][N]
Of course, your companionship[.][N]
would do much to ease my journey, but...[A][N]
It's going to be so dangerous.[A][X]

allow me a short detour.[A][0x02][N]
There is a sacred sword enshrined[.][N]
in an altar east of here.[.][A][N]
The people of Sacae go there[N]
to pray for safety at the onset[.][A][N]
of a long journey.[A][N]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x30][0x01][N]
Oh! How quaint![.][A][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x16][0x01][N]

and hold your tongue![.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Threaten me as you will, but[N]
I'll not give up the Mani Katti.[A][0x02][N]
The Mani Katti is a sacred blade,[.][N]
under divine protection.[A][N]
It cannot be removed from[.][N]

You're a fool, old man.[.][A][N]

What's this?[A][.....][N]
I can't...draw the sword...[.][N]

You have been found wanting.[N]
They have rejected you.[.][A][N]

Then you must hurry and[.][N]
help the priest there.[A][N]
I saw a band of local ruffians[N]
head in there not long ago.[.][A][N]

[OpenFarRight][N]
If you hope to go to the priest's[.][N]

[OpenLeft][N]
You're right...[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][LoadFace][0x1A][0x01][N]
Say, [.][Tact]...[.][A][N]
There are some homes[N]

Perhaps we should go there[N]
and question the residents.[.][A][X]

The three buildings to the[N]

Do you know much about[N]
the sword held at the altar?[A][N]
It's called the Mani Katti,[.][N]
blessed by the spirits.[.][A][0x02][N]
According to the priest,[A][N]
the Mani Katti is waiting for[.][N]
its rightful owner to appear.[.][A][N]

[.....][ToggleSmile]Oh! You're going to help the priest![A][N]
Well, perhaps you could benefit from[N]
something I saw earlier...[A][0x02][N]
The bandits may have the main[.][N]
entrance guarded.[.][A][N]
However, one of the altar's [ToggleRed]walls[.][ToggleRed][N]
is [.][ToggleRed]cracked[.][ToggleRed] and in poor repair.[A][N]
You might be able to create another[.][N]
entrance by hitting that section with[.][A][N]
your weapons.[.][A][0x02][N]
We're all counting on you![A][X]

# 0x089F
You should know something[.][N]
about [ToggleRed]fortresses[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
[ToggleRed]Fortresses[ToggleRed] offer more[.][N]
protection than woods do.[.][.....][N]
Fighting from a space in[N]
a fortress is beneficial.[.][A][0x02][N]
Remember, this holds true[.][N]
for friend and foe alike.[.][.....][N]
Keep this in mind before[N]
engaging your enemy.[A][0x02][N]
[ToggleRed]Fortresses[ToggleRed] also allow[.][N]
injured units to regain[.][N]
hit points.[.][A][0x02][N]
Your units automatically[N]
regain some HP at the[.][N]
[ToggleRed]beginning of your turn[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
The HP you [.][ToggleRed]recover[.][ToggleRed] in[.][N]
one turn is fairly small.[.][A][N]
As long as you remain in[N]
a [ToggleRed]fortress[ToggleRed], you'll regain[.][N]
HP [.][ToggleRed]every turn[ToggleRed], so a[N]
full recovery is possible.[A][0x02][N]
There are other places[N]
where units can [ToggleRed]recover[.][N]
HP[ToggleRed], including [ToggleRed]castle[N]
gates[.][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]thrones[.][ToggleRed], and areas[.][N]
where bosses are found.[.][A][.....][X]

This chapter's goal is[N]
to [.][ToggleRed]seize the throne[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]

Correct! The [.][ToggleRed]lance[.][ToggleRed]![.][N]
Using the right weapon is[.][N]
like a shortcut to victory.[.][A][0x02][N]
To get into the altar, try[N]

Sometimes, you'll get items[.][N]
after defeating enemies.[A][0x02][N]
A single unit can carry a[.][N]
maximum of [.][ToggleRed]five items[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
You might need to drop[N]

The weapon Dorcas[.][N]
is wielding is called a[.][N]
[ToggleRed]handaxe[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
Use it to attack an[.][N]

of a [.][ToggleRed]bow[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
This versatility makes[N]
it a valuable weapon.[.][A][0x02][N]
It's difficult to hit with,[.][N]

Clerics cannot wield[N]

they can't engage[.][N]
in combat.[A][0x02][N]
However, they can use[.][N]
their [ToggleRed]staves[ToggleRed] to[.][N]
[ToggleRed]restore HP[ToggleRed] to[.][N]

Besides [ToggleRed]healing staves[ToggleRed],[.][N]

It's always a good idea[.][N]
to test out any new[.][N]

[ToggleRed]Magic[.][ToggleRed], like Dorcas's[.][N]
throwing axes, [.][ToggleRed]can strike[N]
enemies in adjacent[.][N]
squares as well as those[N]

It's very useful.[.][A][0x02][N]
[ToggleRed]Magic can penetrate even[N]

many situations.[A][0x02][N]
However, [.][ToggleRed]mages have[N]

To avoid counter-[.][N]

Once the marquess is safe,[N]
my men can move in.[.][A][N]
Perhaps the secret passageway...[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Secret passageway?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
An underground tunnel leading[.][N]
to the throne room.[.][A][N]
There are triggers in the barracks[N]
that will open the tunnel.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Head through the passage to[.][N]
the throne room...[A][N]
and rescue the marquess.[A][N]
Once that's done, can you drive[.][N]
the enemy from the castle?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Mmm...[A][N]
If we can release those triggers,[.][N]
my men and I can handle the rest.[.][A][0x02][N]
There are three triggers, though.[.][A][N]
All three need to be released,[N]
or the entrance won't open.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
But the doors to the[N]
barracks are locked.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
The enemy's within.[.][A][0x02][N]
If we don't get inside and finish[.][N]
them, we're stuck.[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
So opening those doors[N]
is our first objective.[.][A][X]

# 0x0937
The goal of this chapter[N]
is to open the doors and[N]
[ToggleRed]reach the 3 triggers[ToggleRed][N]
located inside.[.][A][0x02][N]
To open doors, you need[.][N]

you are unsure how to[.][N]

[ToggleRed]Visiting[ToggleRed] [.][ToggleRed]homes[.][ToggleRed] or[.][N]

Long ago, the marquess was in love[N]

Take this blade. I mean, I[N]

Lord Lundgren is getting serious.[.][A][N]
Deploying siege engines is[N]
no mean feat.[.][A][N]
[OpenRight][N]
What is a ballista?[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
It's a weapon designed for[N]
long-distance attacks.[A][N]
Only archers can use them,[N]
but they can be devastating.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
Florina![OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x33][0x01][OpenFarLeft][N]

The ballista would target[.][N]
you in an instant.[A][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][ClearFace][N]
[OpenRight][N]
Is there a way to combat it?[A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
The safest course is to use[.][A][N]
someone with good defense as[N]
bait, so the enemy wastes arrows.[.][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
Then you can walk up and knock[N]
the fool on the head.[.][A][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][X]

Let's see what we can do![.][A][X]

# 0x09B7
[OpenRight][N]
It's a giant bow?[.][N]

# 0x09B8
On the far side of the hill[.][N]
to the south is a [ToggleRed]ballista[ToggleRed].[.][.....][N]
As Kent said, it's a[N]
weapon intended for[.][N]
trained [ToggleRed]archers[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
The [ToggleRed]attack range[ToggleRed] of[.][N]
[ToggleRed]ballistae[.][ToggleRed] is extremely[.][N]
large,[.....] so they can fire on[N]
enemies at great[N]
distances.[A][0x02][N]
As they can attack[N]
without fear of[.][N]
counterattack, they're[N]
quite useful.[.][A][0x02][N]
To use one, move an[.][N]
[ToggleRed]archer[ToggleRed] onto an[N]
[ToggleRed]unoccupied ballista[.][ToggleRed],[.][.....][N]
and select the [.][ToggleRed]ride[ToggleRed][N]
command.[A][0x02][N]
After that, you can[.][N]
[ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed] as usual.[A][N]
[ToggleRed]Ballistae[.][ToggleRed] can also be[N]
[ToggleRed]moved while in use[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
Additionally, [ToggleRed]ballistae[.][ToggleRed] can[N]
be used by any archer[.][N]
in the field.[.][A][0x02][N]
So, if you can remove[.][N]
the enemy manning the[.][N]
[ToggleRed]ballista[ToggleRed] and move[.][N]
one of your group onto it...[.....][N]
you'll find it most useful.[.][A][.....][X]

Do you remember the[.][N]
weapon [.][ToggleRed]triangle[ToggleRed]?[.][A][N]
[ToggleRed]Axes over lances[ToggleRed] and whatnot?[.][A][N]
This is important, so[.][N]
pay attention.[A][N]
There are some weapons that[.][N]
don't follow the normal rules.[A][N]
This here [ToggleRed]lancereaver[.][ToggleRed] is one of those.[.][A][N]
It's a [.][ToggleRed]sword that reverses the triangle[ToggleRed].[.][A][N]
So if you wield this blade, you[.][N]
can [ToggleRed]best a lance with it[ToggleRed].[.][A][N]
Of course, there's a downside...[N]
[ToggleRed]Axes can best this sword[ToggleRed].[.][A][N]
Take this as a gift. It's your reward[.][N]
for listening to an old man ramble.[.][A][N]
Don't be so shy. It's not like[N]

# 0x09BF
[OpenMidLeft][MoveLeft][N]
First, about Marquess Caelin's illness.[.][A][N]
He really is unwell. He's been abed[.][N]
for nigh on three months.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes][N]
Oh, no... Grandfather...[A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
I heard an interesting rumor[N]
about his condition, though.[A][N]
The people believe that someone's[.][N]
been poisoning the marquess...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenEyes][N]
He's being poisoned!?[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
And this someone...[.][A][.....][ToggleSmile][N]
Well, everyone's too afraid to[N]
mention a name.[.][A][ToggleSmile][N]
However, they say that, as soon[.][N]
as the marquess took ill,[.][A][N]
a certain noble took control of the[.][N]
castle as though it were his own.[.][A][N]
I fed a hungry innkeeper some[.][N]
coin, and he fed me a name.[.][A][0x02][.....][N]
The marquess of Caelin's own[N]
brother, Lord Lundgren.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight][N]
How can this be?[A][N]
How can they allow him[N]
to get away with this?[A][N]
The villagers know he's the one[.][N]
poisoning my grandfather,[.][A][N]
and yet no one raises a hand[N]
against him? Why?[.][A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x2F][0x01][N]
They are afraid, and they lack proof.[.][A][N]
The whisperings of the common[.][N]
people means nothing.[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
That's the truth of it.[.][A][N]
And of the marquess's loyal retainers[.][N]
who might have lent credence to[.][A][N]
these rumors, there is no sign.[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
Are you saying they've[N]

An imposter's appeared, claiming[N]

At least, that's the story Lundgren's[.][N]
telling to all who'll listen.[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
What does that mean?[A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
It means that people are waiting[N]
for two traitorous knights[A][N]

and lay claim to Castle Caelin.[.][A][N]

# 0x09CA
Wallace is a level[N]
12 knight.[.....][N]
He can rise [ToggleRed]as high[.][N]
as level 20[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
Most units can [.][ToggleRed]change[N]
classes[.][ToggleRed] once they[N]
reach [ToggleRed]level 10[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
By changing classes,[N]
units can improve all[.][N]
of their abilities.[.][A][0x02][N]
Movement range,[.][N]
constitution, usable[N]
weapons... Everything.[N]
There are many benefits.[A][0x02][N]
With a single action,[.][N]
you can make your[.][N]
units significantly[.][N]
more powerful.[A][0x02][N]
In order to change[N]
classes, units need[.][N]
to be of a certain level.[.][N]
However, you also need[N]
a [ToggleRed]special item[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
For example, Wallace is[.][N]
carrying a [.][ToggleRed]knight crest[ToggleRed].[.][N]
With this, cavaliers[N]
and knights can change[N]
classes.[A][0x02][N]
Each character class[N]
has its own unique item[.][N]
that allows units of that[.][N]
class to switch to a[N]

He's destroyed the bridge.[A][N]
There's an old snag next to the[.][N]

Hmm...[.....] You look like you've[.][N]
some experience with battle.[A][N]
No need to conceal it.[A][N]
I've fought in many a battle[N]
in my time, I assure you.[.][A][0x02][N]
Let me tell you one thing[.][N]
about combat, though.[.][A][N]
The most important thing[N]
is technique.[.][A][N]
If you've no skill, you'll[N]
rarely strike your enemy.[.][A][N]
My instructor gave me this[N]
secret book long ago.[.][A][N]
It will improve the fighting[N]
prowess of the one who reads it.[A][N]
I'm too old to make use of it,[N]
so why don't you take it?[.][A][X]

# 0x0A2F
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xB1][0x01][N]
I saw them, I did.[A][N]
About a month ago...[A][N]
Marquess Pherae and his men[.][N]
passed right through here.[A][N]
They've all gone missing,[.][N]
haven't they?[.][A][N]
A group as strong as that[.][N]
just up and vanishing...[A][N]
Couldn't have been bandits,[.][N]
but...I don't believe it.[.][A][N]
Must've been something terrible.[A][N]
The world's become a[N]
dangerous place, it has.[A][X]

# 0x0A30
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xB7][0x01][N]
The marquess who leads[N]
Santaruz is Lord Helman.[A][N]
He doesn't ask for much, and[N]
he's a nice enough fellow.[A][N]
I wouldn't call him weak, but he[N]
is more follower than leader.[.][A][N]
Lately, he's been meeting with[N]
Marquess Laus quite a lot.[A][N]
I hope nothing bad[N]
comes of it, but...[.][A][X]

# 0x0A31
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xAF][0x01][N]
It's really important to[N]
trust your companions, yes?[.][A][N]
If you have a boon companion[N]
fighting at your side,[A][N]
you feel stronger and more[N]
confident.[A][0x02][N]
Hm? Who do I think make[.][N]
good companions for whom?[.][A][N]

Let me tell you, I'm[N]

My granddaughter... Marquess[N]
Laus took her away.[.][A][N]
He found her pretty, and[N]
forced her to the castle.[.][A][0x02][N]
It's not much, but please[.][N]
take this.[A][N]
It's a large sword, so you have[.][N]

It's a bit unwieldy, but it is[N]
a mighty weapon nonetheless.[A][N]
I hope you can defeat the[.][N]

Castle Ostia?[.][A][N]
What could that fool of a[.][N]

Laus has no chance of defeating[.][N]
Lycia's most powerful territory![A][N]
The marquess's son, Erik, is nothing[N]
but a power-hungry dullard![.][A][N]
And the marquess himself is[.][N]
a lecher, plain and simple![.][A][N]
What a pair![A][N]
Do they believe they're a match[.][N]

There's a young woman staying[.][N]
in a village on the harbor.[.][A][N]
Her speech, her looks, everything[.][N]
about her has the seeming[.][A][N]

The marquess's attentions border[N]
on obsession.[.][.....] He's sent countless[A][N]
envoys to invite her to the castle,[.][N]
but she rejects him at every turn.[A][N]
Now, the marquess has guards around[.][N]
the village keeping her trapped.[A][N]
She has no way to escape.[.][.....][N]
It's so sad.[A][X]

The pirates from that citadel in the[N]

Ostia's position had always[.][N]

He tried to convince my father[N]

My father would not be pursuaded,[.][.....][N]

Let me give you a brief[.][N]
explanation of magic.[.][.....][N]
Magic can be divided into[.][N]
three large groups.[.][A][0x02][N]
[ToggleRed]Anima[.][ToggleRed] magic is[.][N]
based on nature. Its attacks[N]
include Fire and Thunder.[.][A][0x02][N]
The basic attack of [ToggleRed]Light[.][ToggleRed][N]
is Lightning,[.][.....] while [.][ToggleRed]Dark[ToggleRed][N]
magic uses a spell called Flux.[.][A][0x02][N]
Each type of magic has an[.][N]
affinity for other types of[.][N]
magic, similar to the[.][N]
weapons triangle.[.][A][0x02][N]
[ToggleRed]Light[.][ToggleRed] is [ToggleRed]strong vs. dark[.][ToggleRed],[.][N]
[ToggleRed]dark[ToggleRed] is [ToggleRed]strong vs. anima[ToggleRed], and[.][N]
[ToggleRed]anima[.][ToggleRed] is [ToggleRed]strong vs. light[ToggleRed].[.][.....][N]
This is the [ToggleRed]Trinity of Magic[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02][N]
So, a monk's [.][ToggleRed]light magic[.][ToggleRed] is[.][N]
[ToggleRed]strong[ToggleRed] against a shaman's[.][N]
[ToggleRed]dark magic[ToggleRed]. Remember[N]
which class has an advantage[N]
over which other class.[.][A][.....][X]

I've been posing as a member of[.][N]

That's where I got this[.][N]

[OpenRight][N]
Black Fang...[.][.....] They're the assassins[N]
guild that Erik spoke of.[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
Yes, we've known of their[.][N]
existence for quite some time.[A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][N]
Explain.[A][SendToBack][X]

# 0x0AFD
[OpenLeft][N]
The Black Fang is a guild of[N]
assassins founded about ten[.][A][N]
years ago by Brendan Reed.[N]
They're based in Bern.[A][N]
Their arms reached quickly[N]
in several other countries.[.][A][N]
Originally, they targeted only[N]
nobles who abused their positions.[A][N]
The masses saw them as chivalrous,[N]
defenders of the common man.[A][N]
Their activities found[N]
wide support.[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][N]
Chivalrous...[.][A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
Then about a year ago, Brendan[N]
got married again.[A][N]
Black Fang's operations have[N]
slowly changed since then.[A][N]
Now, they'll take on any[N]
target, no matter how difficult,[A][N]
as long as they're paid.[A][N]
And they're no longer killing only[N]
criminals; anyone is a fair target.[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][N]
Is this Black Fang responsible for[N]
what's happened to my grandfather?[A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
Yes.[A][N]
We've learned of a mystery man[N]
named Nergal, behind Reed's wife.[.][A][N]
It seems the Black Fang is performing[.][N]
secret tasks across Lycia for Nergal.[.][A][N]
Nergal's trusted retainer Ephidel[.][N]
is with Marquess Laus.[A][N]
He manipulated Laus into hatching[.][N]
the rebellion plot against Ostia.[.][A][N]
The first to answer Laus's[N]
call for rebellion was...[.][A][N]
Marquess Santaruz.[A][N]

Lord Helman...[.....][N]
Why would you...[A][ToggleMouthMove][N]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]......[A][ToggleMouthMove][SendToBack][N]

Next was Lord Elbert,[.][N]
Marquess Pherae.[A][N]
[OpenRight][N]
You're telling me that my[.][N]
father endorsed this plan?[A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
I cannot say.[.][A][N]
I do know that he is with[.][N]
Marquess Laus currently.[A][N]
In a place called...[N]
the Dragon's Gate.[A][N]
[OpenRight][N]
Dragon's Gate?[.....][N]
Where is that?[A][X]

# 0x0AFE
[OpenLeft][N]
On an isle called Valor, off[N]
the southern coast of Lycia.[A][0x02][N]
I apologize, but that is[N]
all the information I have.[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][N]
Of all places to be, Valor...[.][.....][N]

It's said that those who step[.][N]

If that's where my father is,[.][N]
however,[.....] I will go and find him.[A][N]
And this "Dragon's Gate," too![A][N]

Shouldn't you stay[N]

Laus must be stopped.[.][A][N]
Otherwise, they might target[N]
my grandfather again.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][.....][N]

[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x85][0x01][N]
It's a ruin from the Scouring...[N]
The residence of a dark sorcerer.[.][A][N]
I've found several ancient tomes[N]
here. Fascinating stuff, really.[A][N]
If I can unlock their secrets,[N]
I can move closer to the darkness.[A][N]
From what I've gathered so far, I[.][N]
must make further reparations.[A][ToggleSmile][N]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][N]
Reparations?[A][N]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidRight][N]
Yes.[A][N]
It's the fate of those who[N]
study dark magic.[.][A][N]
If you covet the dark, you must[.][N]
enter it of your own free will.[.][A][N]
You must erase yourself and[.][N]
become an empty vessel.[.][A][N]
Only then will you be able to[.][N]
receive the dark and master it.[.][A][N]
If your disposition is weak,[N]
the dark will overwhelm you.[A][N]
You will be...lost...[.][A][N]
...Ofttimes,[A][N]
you will forget why you[.][N]
seek the power to begin with.[.][A][N]
Only a few people ever[N]
gain true power.[A][N]
To win such a prize, one's self is a[N]
small and insignificant sacrifice.[A][ToggleSmile][N]

[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A][N]

Bramimond, one of the eight[.][A][N]

entirely to the dark.[.][A][N]

dissolved in a river of dark.[.][A][N]
That is how he received the[.][N]
power to best dragons.[A][N]

[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x1C][0x01][DelayBlinking][N]
...Nils.[A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
When we pulled Ninian from the[N]

[OpenFarRight][N]
...Was he after you because you[.][N]
have[.....] the power to call dragons?[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
...I think it's because we can[N]
open the Dragon's Gate.[.][A][N]
Just calling them? Nergal can[.][N]
do that on his own.[.][A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][ClearFace][N]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x0C][0x01][N]
Are you serious?[A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
Yes, but it requires a tremendous[.][N]
amount of quintessence.[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
Quintessence?[.][A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
That's what Nergal called it.[.][A][N]
The substance of the human[N]
spirit... Power. Energy.[A][N]
The essence of life itself.[.][A][N]
...Nergal, he stole[.][N]
this quintessence.[A][N]

# 0x0BE4
[OpenLeft][N]
Neither Ninian nor I[N]
have that power.[A][N]
Lyn knows. We only have[.][N]
our special power...[A][N]
Anyway, Nergal needed to gather[.][N]
a large amount of quintessence.[.][A][N]
So he sent his henchman, Ephidel,[.][N]
to get close to Marquess Laus.[A][N]
He sought to plant the seeds of[.][N]
war in Darin's power-hungry heart.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][N]
...To what end?[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
It seems the quintessence in each[.][N]
person varies in strength.[A][N]
A person of strong mind and body[N]
has hundreds of times more[A][N]
energy than the average person.[.][A][N]
It sounds like there aren't[.][N]
many people like that, though.[A][N]
It took too long for Nergal to[N]
find people with enough strength.[.][A][N]
Although it would take time, Nergal[.][N]
said the easiest way to get[.][A][N]
that much quintessence was[N]
by starting a war.[A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x0D][0x01][N]
...So he planned to make up for[.][N]
quality with quantity? Is that it?[A][CloseSpeechFast][N]
Black-hearted fiend! Are all[N]
men nothing but pawns to him?[.][A][SendToBack][X]

# 0x0BE5
[OpenLeft][N]
...Ephidel brought Elbert to[N]
the Dragon's Gate.[A][N]
He said he'd found the ideal[N]
source they had sought.[.][A][N]
Nergal's plans for war had been[.][N]
stopped, and yet...he was happy.[A][N]
He'd taken so much energy from[N]
the knights traveling with Elbert.[A][N]
He was sure he'd get even[.][N]
better quintessence from Elbert...[A][N]

he had a son.[.][A][N]

Welcome,[.....] children of Roland.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x0C][0x01][N]
We've come from Lycia,[N]
old man. Do you understand?[.][A][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][N]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x16][0x01][N]
What do you mean?[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
I think I know.[.][A][N]
Thousands of years ago, man and[.][N]
dragon fought on this continent.[A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
Yes, mankind won, and the[.][N]
dragons fled this world.[A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
That's correct.[.][A][N]
Man against dragon... The war[.][N]
that we know as the Scouring.[.][A][N]
And you know of the Eight Legends,[N]
the heroes who led man to victory?[A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
Yes, we've all heard the stories[N]
of the Eight Legends.[.][A][N]
I was raised in Sacae, so I[.][N]
know of Hanon, the horseman.[A][N]
[OpenFarRight][N]
Sacae is where Hanon was born.[A][N]
Our country, Lycia, was founded[.][N]
by the hero Roland.[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][ClearFace][OpenFarRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x1B][0x01][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x16][0x01][N]
That's why you called us[.....][N]
"children of Roland," right?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
That is correct,[.....] daughter[.][N]

[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
Who are you?[A][SendToBack][X]

# 0x0C43
[OpenMidLeft][N]
I am Athos.[.][A][N]
Many choose simply to call[N]
me Archsage.[A][N]
[OpenRight][N]
Athos?![.][.....][N]
It can't be...[A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight][N]
Huh? What?![.][A][ClearFace][N]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x0C][0x01][N]
Archsage Athos was one of[.][N]
the Eight Legends.[A][N]
If you really were him,[.][N]
old man...[A][N]
you'd have to be over[.][N]
a thousand years old.[.][A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
The world is full[.][N]

Solve one, and along[N]
comes another...[A][N]
Before I knew it, I'd grown[.][N]
distant from my fellow man.[.][A][N]
Hunger... It knows no[.][N]

"Living legend"...[N]
Now I see it.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
You're here because you want[N]
to stop Nergal, aren't you?[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
Yes. Did you receive word[.][N]
from Marquess Ostia?[A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
No...[.][A][N]
I am aware of most things that[N]
occur on the continent.[.][A][N]
However, knowledge is not enough[N]
for me to prevent disaster.[.][A][N]
[OpenFarRight][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x16][0x01][N]
Nils said something similar[.][N]
to that before.[.][A][N]
"With my special power, I[.][N]
can sense danger coming,[A][N]
but I can't do anything to[N]
stop it."[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Nils...[.][N]
One of the children of destiny.[.][A][N]
[OpenFarRight][N]
He's here with us, but something[N]
outside caught his attention.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]

How do we stop him?[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
Yes, what can you tell us?[N]
What wisdom can you share?[A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Mm. Your foe is, like me, no[N]
longer...altogether human.[A][N]
It will be difficult to slay him[N]
through traditional means.[A][CloseSpeechSlow][N]
He wields a terrible power.[.][A][N]
His endless strength stems from[.][N]
an ancient, forbidden magic...[A][N]
To defeat him, you will need[N]
a suitable response.[A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
Response?[.][A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
...While he is resting, you must[N]
find the power to oppose him.[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
Tell us what it is![.][.....][N]
We'll do anything!![.][A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
It will be harder than you can[N]
imagine. Great trials await you.[A][N]
...As does great despair.[.][.....][N]
You may regret your decision.[.][A][N]
Will you stay the course,[.][N]

Long ago...the lord who ruled[.][N]
this area was an awful man.[.][A][N]
Every night he would hold an[N]
extravagant feast below the castle.[.][A][N]
Meanwhile, we villagers slowly[N]
starved to death.[.][A][N]
One day, though, it ended.[N]
The lord was dead.[A][N]
The Black Fang had given[N]
him a death sentence.[.][A][N]
To us, the Black Fang were heroes.[N]
It matters not what others said.[A][N]
That's what makes it so hard...[.][N]
Why did they have to change?[A][0x02][N]
Helping you...means that I'm[N]

The prince is a wise lad. He's the[N]
royal family's first prodigy.[.][A][N]
Yet King Desmond ignores the boy's[N]
talents, and they wither.[.][A][0x02][N]
Here...I'd like you[.][N]
to take this.[.][A][N]
This is an Earth seal.[A][N]
This one item contains the[N]
powers of many:[.][A][N]
Knight crest, Guide ring,[.][N]
Hero crest, Elysian whip...[.][A][N]
I am unsure why I would entrust this[N]
treasure to a complete stranger.[A][N]
I cannot explain it, but I have[.][N]

Aren't you a lovely one?[A][N]
I pray you'll forgive the[.][N]

[OpenMidRight][N]
Pascal Grentzer, once and former[N]
count of Bern's Landskron.[A][0x02][N]
A man whose battlefield prowess[.][N]
was feared far and wide...[A][N]
Until you invited your citizens[.][N]
to your castle and slaughtered them.[A][N]
Stripped of your title, you fled the[N]
king and joined the Black Fang.[.][A][N]
Is that an accurate[.][N]
summary?[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
Hmmm...[.][A][N]
You know me well,[.][N]
it would seem.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
You were even made one[N]
of the Four Fangs.[A][N]
Spending the rest of your days in[.][N]
this place seems so wasteful.[.][A][N]
I've heard that Brendan[.][N]
calls you "the Beast."[A][N]
A monster who would massacre an[.][N]
entire village to kill one person.[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
He doesn't know how to[N]
enjoy his work.[.][A][N]
"Never harm any innocents."[.][N]
Bah.[A][N]

Yeah.[.][A][N]
Few people call this area home.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x16][0x01][N]
Hector, are you sure about this?[N]
Is the Fire Emblem really here?[.][A][N]

Yes, I paid a small ransom[N]

There's no mistake.[.][A][N]

Shouldn't we tell the chief[.][N]

You don't understand, do you?[.][A][N]
If we tell anyone, the Four[.][N]

OK! I don't care who, but someone[.][N]

[OpenMidRight][N]
Me?[.][A][N]

You're really pushing yourself,[.][N]
taking on all these enemies.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
It's not for pleasure![.....][N]
Hey, who are you, anyway!?[A][N]
You're not with those[.][N]
guys, are you?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Me? No, I'm not.[A][N]
I came out here because I[.][N]
heard I could make some gold.[.][A][N]
What a joke![A][N]
Only a fool would work[N]
for this piddling amount![.][A][N]
Skills like mine do not[.][N]
come cheap.[.][A][N]

You seem pretty...[N]
sure of yourself.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
I am Farina, a mercenary attached[.][N]
to the Strongwings,[.][A][N]
Ilia's 3rd division of pegasus[N]
knights. No doubt you've heard of me![.][A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
I've heard Ilian mercenaries[N]
never betray their employers.[.][A][N]
So...how much would it cost[.][N]
to hire you for ourselves?[A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Ah, so you've an appreciation[.][N]
for true warriors after all?[A][N]
Let me see...[.][A][N]
I'm yours for 20,000 gold.[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
20,000 gold!?![A][N]
That's laughable. No sellsword[N]
is worth that much![.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
I beg to differ.[A][N]
Your journey is a long one, is it[.][N]
not? More than one battle, surely.[A][N]
That requires a special contract,[.][N]
special arrangements.[.][A][N]
Not to be morbid, but there are[.][N]
sympathy payments to my family[A][N]
in the unlikely event of my death,[N]
for example.[A][N]
Not to mention bonuses and[N]
hazard pay, medical treatment...[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
Hold on![N]
That's enough!![.][A][N]
...Your fee includes all[N]
of that, right?[.][A][N]

We've finally arrived.[A][N]
I can't believe they built a[N]

[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x05][0x01][N]
Bern is the only country[N]
on the continent where[A][N]
wyverns still fly.[A][N]
With its wyvern riders,[.][A][N]
I imagine this castle is the[N]
best-defended anywhere.[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x19][0x01][N]
I agree. Look at the path[.][N]
leading up the mountain's face.[.][A][N]
It would be impossible to scale[.][N]
that in a direct assault.[.][A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenLeft][N]
Defenders positioned higher up[N]
would have a clear advantage.[.][A][N]
Even the best soldiers would[N]
be taken out with ease.[.][A][N]
Hm...[.][.....] Look at that. They don't[.][N]
have any sentries posted.[.][A][N]
They must have a lot of faith[.][N]
in their defenses.[A][N]

Look at these surroundings![.][A][N]
They probably make do simply[N]
with patrols within the castle.[.][A][0x02][N]
The mighty Bern.[N]
I'd not like it as an enemy.[A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
And yet, from this impregnable[N]
fortress, a treasure was stolen.[A][N]
Perhaps the king really is[N]
responsible for all this.[.][A][N]
It's hard to imagine any thief[N]
cracking Bern's defenses.[.][A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenFarRight][N]
You're right.[.][A][N]

amazing village...[A][.....][N]
It was unbelievable, but in that[N]
place, humans and dragons[.][A][N]
lived together in cooperation.[A][X]

They were both similar to[.][N]

hundreds of years before.[.][A][X]

[SetName]Athos[.][N]
They had refused to fight[.][N]
humans in the war, and[A][N]
instead, they retreated[.][N]
to this wasteland.[A][N]
They desired nothing but to[.][N]
remain hidden from the outside.[.][A][N]
Nergal and I crafted a barrier[N]
and created an oasis for them.[A][N]
Upon their invitation, we[.][N]
lived there with them.[A][0x02][N]
Our life there...[.][A][N]
It was calm and satisfying.[.][A][N]
At some point, the village[N]
became known as Arcadia,[A][N]
a place of perfect peace[N]
for travelers gone astray.[A][X]

# 0x0E38
[SetName]Athos[.][N]
The dragons' libraries were[.][N]
a dream come true to us.[A][N]
We studied their language and[.][N]
history with unbridled passion.[.][A][N]
A century, then two...[N]
Time passed in an eye's blink.[A][N]
And yet, slowly, our thoughts[.][N]
turned down different paths.[A][X]

# 0x0E39
[SetName]Lyn[.][N]
In what way?[A][X]

# 0x0E3A
[SetName]Athos[.][N]
I wanted to share the[.][N]
dragons' wisdom with others.[A][N]
My hope was for our earthly[.][N]
paradise to spread outward.[.][A][X]

# 0x0E3B
[SetName]Hector[N]
And Nergal?[.][A][X]

# 0x0E3C
[SetName]Athos[.][N]
Ah, Nergal... He took the[.][N]
dragons' knowledge...[.][A][N]
He learned the art of stealing[N]
the essence from living[.][A][N]
creatures and turning it[N]
into power.[.][A][X]

# 0x0E3D
[SetName]Athos[.][N]
...It was terrible.[.][A][N]
When we discovered what[.][N]
he was doing, the elders[A][N]
and I tried to pursuade[.][N]
him to stop.[A][N]
But the power bewitched him,[N]
and he was deaf to our pleas.[.][A][N]
He started with small creatures[.][N]
and grew ever more confident.[.][A][N]
Then, he began draining the[.][N]
quintessence of humans.[.][A][N]
The villagers and I joined[N]
forces and...defeated him.[A][N]
Or so we thought, but...[A][X]

# 0x0E3E
[SetName]Eliwood[.][N]
......[A][X]

# 0x0E3F
[SetName]Athos[.][N]
After he was banished from[N]
Arcadia, Nergal fled to Bern.[.][A][N]
He increased his power[N]
slowly to avoid our eye.[A][0x02][N]
Using quintessence, he made[.][N]
his "puppets," the morphs.[A][0x02][N]
They're bewitching in form,[.][N]
with intellects beyond human.[.][A][N]
I'm sure you've laid eyes[.][N]
on them yourselves.[.][A][.....][N]
Jet black hair, pale complexion,[N]
and blood-red lips...[.][A][N]
Their most striking features[N]
are their glittering gold eyes.[.][A][X]

Hey, Graybeard![.][N]
Are these guys...[.][A][N]
[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x1B][0x01][N]
Yes, I'm sure of it.[N]
They are his morphs...[A][N]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x16][0x01][N]
It's true...[N]
They're all eerily similar.[.][A][N]
That reminds me... That man[.][N]
on Valor, Ephidel...[A][N]
Black Fang's Sonia, too...[A][N]
Are you saying that he[N]
made them all?[A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenLeft][N]
It is an abomination. A crime[.][N]
against all that is natural.[A][N]
When Nergal began using morphs[N]
to carry out his plans,[.][A][N]
his power had grown beyond[N]
our ability to contain him.[.][A][N]
After humans, his next target[.][N]
became the essence of dragons.[A][N]
His next target had to be[.][N]
Arcadia.[A][N]
I concealed our paradise behind[.][N]
a curtain of sandstorms.[A][N]
I then hid in the underground[.][N]
ruins and waited for him.[.][A][N]
I did not hope to defeat him.[.][N]
Just to exchange blows...[.][A][N]
and then draw him into the[N]
desert, which would be his end.[.][A][SendToBack][X]

# 0x0E4E
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x02][0x01][N]
But Nergal never showed[.][N]
up, did he?[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenLeft][N]
Correct.[A][N]
I've no idea how he[.][N]
managed it but...[.][A][N]
He called those siblings[N]
through the Dragon's Gate.[A][N]
And now...[A][N]
he plans to call a horde of[.][N]
dragons to this land.[.][A][SendToBack][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
What do we have to[N]
do to stop him?[.][A][SendToBack][N]
[SendToBack][OpenLeft][N]
Our last hope is the power[N]
of the legendary items.[.][A][N]
It would take too long for[N]
us to gather all of them.[.][A][N]
I will go to the Shrine of Seals[N]
and tell Bramimond everything.[A][N]
We must have his power,[.][N]
no matter the cost.[.][A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenFarRight][N]
Then we should go to the[N]
Dragon's Gate ahead of you.[.][A][N]
[SendToBack][OpenLeft][N]
What!?[A][SendToBack][N]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][N]
That's a good idea.[.][A][N]
Even though you cannot[N]
harm Nergal himself,[A][N]
you can certainly do some[.][N]
damage to his troops.[.][A][SendToBack][N]
[OpenFarLeft][N]
If we don't answer Nergal's[.][N]
invitation soon...[A][N]
He'll continue to send out[N]
troops after us.[A][N]
If that's going to happen, we[.][N]
might as well take the fight to him![A][N]

by any more of his acts![A][N]

Lord Hector...[N]
About last night...[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
Don't worry about it.[.][A][N]
No matter the clamor I[N]
raise, my brother is dead.[A][N]
All I can do now is try not to[N]
distract Eliwood and the others.[A][N]
I must put on a strong face,[N]

you may hate me and[.][N]

You should not do that.[.][A][N]

ordered that, should he die, I must[.][N]
keep that news secret from you.[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]
But why?[A][N]
[OpenMidRight][N]
This is what was written in[.][N]
Lord Uther's letter...[A][0x02][N]
"He is true to his[N]
own feelings...[.][A][N]
If asked to choose between[N]
his brother and the world,[A][N]
he would not hesitate[.][N]
in rushing to my side.[A][N]
Though he often speaks in anger,[N]
we are brothers. We are all we have.[A][N]
I have never doubted his affection.[.][A][0x02][N]
Yet what if the choice were[.][N]
between brother and friend?[.][A][N]
To choose one would mean[N]
abandoning the other.[.][A][N]
He would come to despise[N]
himself, whatever his choice.[.][A][N]
I cannot force him to make[N]
such a decision."[.][A][N]
[OpenMidLeft][N]

A millennium ago...[.][A][N]
Man chased dragonkind[.][N]
from the land, exiled us.[.][A][0x02][N]
We had no place to go...[N]
not on this world.[A][N]
So we used the Dragon's Gate[N]
to flee into another world.[.][A][0x02][N]
When we passed through this[.][N]
chasm in space and time,[A][N]
many of us were lost. Still,[N]
we endured the journey.[.][A][N]
We found humans there, too,[.][N]
but they were few in number.[A][N]
We had a few skirmishes, but[N]
at last, we found a home.[.][A][X]

# 0x0E9B
[SetName]Nils[N]
We were stable there,[.][N]
happy, even.[A][N]
But some thought back on our[N]
former home, and when we did,[.][A][N]
his voice reached out to us.[A][0x02][N]
Ninian was a medium in the[N]
other world, an oracle of sorts.[A][N]
She sat at the Dragon Shrine.[.][A][N]
She held much power.[A][N]
We were in prayer at the[N]
shrine when it happened...[A][N]
We heard a voice calling to[.][N]
us from the Dragon's Gate.[A][N]
It was the voice of an old[N]
friend......[A][N]
We knew we weren't supposed[.][N]
to open the gate and return[.][A][N]
to this world.[A][N]
We had no idea that the owner[.][N]
of that voice was Nergal...[.][A][X]

Nergal...[.][A][X]

# 0x0E9D
[SetName]Nils[N]
But something unexpected[N]
happened.[.][A][0x02][N]
When we opened the Dragon's[.][N]
Gate and traveled here again,[.][A][N]
we had lost almost all of[.][N]
our strength...[.][A][N]
The quintessence left within[N]
us was less even than that[A][N]
of an average human.[A][0x02][N]
In order to sustain ourselves,[N]
in order to breathe the air of[A][N]
this world, we took human form.[.][A][N]
We placed our energies within[.][N]
a dragonstone.[A][0x02][N]
But our dragonstone was[.][N]
taken...stolen.[.][A][N]
Nergal hoped to use it as a[.][N]
tool to summon other dragons.[.][A][0x02][N]
...Until we escaped.[A][N]
We couldn't let our foolishness[.][N]
condemn our friends.[A][X]

# 0x0E9E

Disguised as a dancer and a[.][N]

You were so good to us.[.][A][N]
We didn't want to cause[.][N]

After we left Lyn at Caelin,[N]
we were captured again...[.][A][X]

# 0x0EA1
[SetName]Nils[N]
...We decided that the only[.][N]
way to escape was[.][A][N]
to cut short our own lives.[.][A][N]
That was when we met[N]
Lord Elbert.[A][N]
He was so strong,[.][.....][N]
so kind...[A][N]
He knew what we were...[.][N]
and what we had done,[.][A][N]
and he never once[.][N]
condemned us.[.][A][0x02][N]
On the contrary, he tried to[N]
set us at ease with stories...[A][N]
Stories of his family,[N]
of his homeland.[A][0x02][N]
Ninian and I...[.][A][N]
We listened to his stories,[.][N]
and we grew to love his[.][A][N]
gentle wife and his son.[A][0x02][N]
Premonition... No, that is[N]
too strong a word, but[A][N]
we felt his son would be[N]
the one to save us.[.][A][N]
