[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
...[.][ToggleMouthMove][.....]All right.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
There was this man--a giant with a
great beard--carrying a girl[A]
on his shoulders.[.][A][0x02]
The girl called to him "Father,"[.....]
and she was smiling, happy.[.][A]
Then the father said to her,
"Yes, my beloved daughter?"[.][A][0x02]
That's all, really. [A]
But it felt as though...[.....]
It felt like a long-past memory.[A][0x02][.....]
The man looked a bit like my
own father, I suppose.[A]
But who is the little girl?[.]
Aye, she was a cute one.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What color was her hair?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Huh. Blue.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
And the man's hair? His moustache?[A]

I'm not sure I like it.[.][A]

Don't get ahead of yourself![A]
There are plenty of people

Hector, you still remember that time?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What time?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
You know, what was it--[.]
ten years ago?[A][0x02]
When the lords of Lycia held the
oath rites, back in Ostia?[A]
"Should one land of Lycia be
attacked, all will fight as one..."[.][A]
Remember? While our parents[.][A]
were off pledging their oaths, we[.]
kids were in that one room.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yeah, I remember.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
We had to act in a manner befitting[.]
the children of nobility, or some such[A]
nonsense. I just remember being stuck[.][A]
in there, having to sit in that chair[.]
talking to whoever was next to me.[A][0x02][ToggleSmile]
Course, wouldn't you know that
Erik of Laus was on my right?[.][A]
Man, I heard more than enough[.]
sweet talk from that one![.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]
Right, right. That was the first
time any of us met, after all.[A]
He had no idea who you were--[.][A]
he just wanted to get in favor
with a lordling of Lycia.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ToggleSmile]
Aye, he was all mouth[.]
anyway.[.][A]
Saying things like "let us join forces
for the good of Lycia," and such...[.][A]
then running when[.]
things turned sour.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]
Aw, don't be too hard on him.[.][A]
When he jumped up, yelling
about us swearing our own oaths,[A]
then cut his hand like that...[A]
No one else knew what to do, either.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, everyone's heard the stories.[.]
They all know it's the warriors' custom.[A][0x02]
Each cuts his own hand, then shakes[.]
hands with his brothers...[A]
What man wouldn't want to do that?[A]
Only one had the guts to meet him, though.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...You know, back then,[.]
I'm proud I took your hand.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][......]
We are friends, sharing[.]
a life-dream now, an ambition.[A]
When one is in danger, the
other risks his life to protect him...[A][0x02]
That's why you came, isn't it?
Because you remembered?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Heh. I've got no plans to break[.]
my oath. Not now, not ever.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Likewise.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Well, then let's live long and in health![.][A]
I don't want to hear any excuses about not
being able to come help when we're old men.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
It's a deal.[.....]

I was watching your swordplay[.]
just now. You're quite good.[A]
I had no idea you could[.]
handle a sword so well.[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I've had my share of practice.[A]
Just...I'm not sure how well it[.]
will serve me in real battle.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Where did you learn[.]
that style?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
My father taught me the basics.[.][A]
Then, I received some instruction[.]
from Marcus.[A]
I spar once every two months
with Hector, too.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sparring, huh?
Interested in a new partner?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Who, you?[.][.....]
I don't have a problem with that.[.][A]

Are there any lordlings close to my[.]
age, besides you and Hector?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Of course.[.....]
There's quite a few.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Then, some are women, I take it?[A]
If they enjoyed swordplay as much as
I do, we'd become fast friends.[.][A]
What do you think?[.....] Know anyone?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hmm...[.....]
Let me see...[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Someone skilled in the spear, or axe,[.]
or bow would be fine, too, of course.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]
I don't know any ladies[.]
skilled in the martial arts.[A]
Most of them never leave
the castle, for that matter.[A]
The only time I see them
are at the banquets and such.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Banquets...[.][.....]
I see.[A]
Those are no place for someone
from the plains, like me.[.][A]
Oh well...[A][0x02]
Chancellor Reissmann tells me[.]
I need to learn manners.[A]
I have to attend all these affairs
in place of my ill grandfather, you see.[A]
The chancellor doesn't think I act

That's why I was hoping to find[.]
a lady that could teach me.[.][A]

you're worrying too much.[.][A]
You should relax, take it in stride.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, but I have so far to go![.]
I'm not like a lady at all.[.][A]
My grandfather took me in,
a mixed-blood child,[A]

Lycia will not be so accepting.[.][A]
I do not want the Sacae blood in my[.]

I seem to remember, Lyndis,[.][A]
back then, you didn't know what to
think about your noble Lycian blood,[A]
but the Sacae blood in you...[.][A]
for that you had nothing

Very serious.[.][A]
You should be calling me
"Lady Serra," you know, really.[.][A]

There was all this talk about family status[.]

My parents decided to put me in[.]
an abbey when I was still a child.[A]

That abbey you lived

So...that was the place?[A]

It was an orphanage for those[.]

You know, I visited there once.[.]
Dismal place, it was.[.][A]
After my brother donated money
it got a little better, true...[.][A]

Y-Yes, I suppose...[.][.....]
We were always short on food.[.][A]
The winters were cold, with no wood[.]

Hector may not

The path of Eliwood may[.]

people with his inventiveness.[A]
By not walking the clear path,
he always forges new ones...[A]

Three years ago...

Lord Pent brought you home

You were only 12...[.][A]
You had such deep, purple eyes,[.]
sparkling with intelligence...[A]
[OpenMidRight]
L-Lady Louise, now is really not
the time for such old memories...[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hush... Listen.[.][A][0x02]
Lord Pent had only just become
a mage general then...[A]
and he was hardly ever
home in the castle.[.][A]
I was so happy to have such[.]
a cute young student around.[A]
But that student shut himself[.]
away in his room all the time...[A]
just reading his books.[.][A]
He didn't eat, he hardly slept,[.]
and soon, he collapsed.[.][A]

That's right.[.][A]
You never let anyone do nice things[.]
for you, and then you just fall apart![A][ToggleSmile]

you back to health...[.][A][0x02]
You thought of us[.]
as total strangers...[.][A]
You always spurn those
who try to help you most...[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
N-No, that's not true![A]
I could never think of you...[.][.....]

So, who do you think
Lyn will end up with?[.][A]
Lord Eliwood?[.][.....]
Lord Hector, maybe?[.][A][ToggleSmile]

the contest to just those two.[A]

I was born as the youngest

I hoped to someday protect

one must...strike...those enemies.[A]

When Nergal first created[.]
his morphs, he was not alone.[.][A]
He had one assistant.[.][A][0x02]
A mercenary who wanted
desperately to bring back[.][A]
a friend he had lost in battle.[.][A]

[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Jaffar, can I ask you something?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What is it?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Well, um...[A]
Why were you...[.][.....]
with Nergal?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
When I first met you,[.][A]
it was after you had
come with Moth--[A]
I mean, with Sonia
and the Black Fang.[.][A]
So I thought at first that
you were with the Black Fang.[.][A][0x02]
Then, my brothers told me[.]
that you had come with Nergal.[A]
I had never met Nergal, but...[A]
As Nergal's servants,[.][A]
you and Sonia must have[.]
been friends, right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I was selected
by Nergal as a child.[.][A]
He raised me to become
his Angel of Death.[.][A]
...I...did not think.[.]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I did not feel.[.][A]
I did what I was told...
...and that was all.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
I entered the Black Fang
with the intent of infiltrating[.][A]
them, of using them...[A]
I had heard rumors about Sonia
and her daughter being there...[.][A][0x02]
That child, raised by Sonia...[A]
I thought she must be[.]
something like myself...[A][0x02]
But...the first[.]
time I saw you,[.][A]
you were with the Reed
brothers, laughing...[.][A]
in that dazzling light...[.]
as if you belonged there...[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]......[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]I became
very interested in you...[.][A]
When you saved my life...[.][.....]
I thought I had you...[A][CloseSpeechSlow][......]
But I couldn't do it...[.][A][0x02]
Nino, that was the first
time I ever had...feelings...[.][A]

It is... It's my real mother's.[.][A][0x02]
It got there when Sonia[.]

[OpenMidLeft]

You should keep it...[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
I can't even remember[.][.....]
my own mother's face.[.][A]
Even though she died protecting me.[.][A][0x02]
So...I don't think I[.....]

is filled with pictures. [.][A]
There are fields of rolling,
green grass, flowers that[.][A]
explode into color, and[.]
clouds that crawl across[A]
the seamless sky. Training to[.]
be a mage requires more than[A]
staying in your room studying[.]

Until then, look at these[.][A]

Knowledge of the ancient magics[.]

Good Lord, man, you must be...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, no! They are alive![.][A]
But...barely.[.][.....]
They merely subsist...[A][0x02][.....]
As you know, elder magic is[.]
based on the forces of darkness...[A]
It is even more powerful than nature
magic, which is often called anima.[.][A]
But to use this magic, you must[.]
invite the dark forces within you.[A]
The temptation to submit to[.]
the darkness is...great.[A]

darkness took my brothers...[A]

Lord Heath...[.][A]
Forgive my impertinence, but
I must ask you something.[.][A]
Why did you have to leave[.][.....]
the knights of Bern?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Well, that is impertinent...[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Forgive me.[.][A]
But as the commander of Caelin's
knights,[.....] it is my duty to test[A]
the loyalty of any new recruit,[.]
to learn about his past...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What!?[.....] You are the commander?[.]
You are quite...young.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Lord Heath, please help[.]
me to understand.[.][A]
The wyvern riders of Bern[.]
are considered to be the[A]
strongest knights in the land.[A]
Surely we Lycian knights
would fall to their lances[A]
if we met them head on...[.][A]
So why would you leave
Bern for Lycia?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
...Bern is not as it once was.[A]
Our sovereign has imprisoned[A]
all those nobles who
do not meet his favor.[A]
And their fabled power is[.]
a feeble joke.[A]
The only real strength
of Bern's knights these[.][A]
days is in their boasting.[A]
And their general is good[.][A]
for nothing but wagging[.]
his tail at the king.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
There was an uprising on our
frontier, a rebellion of sorts.[.][A]
The knights were ordered to[.]
put it down and kill the rebels.[A]
Our commander went to scout[.]
out the enemy camp.[.][A]
This "uprising" was nothing more
than a group of unarmed peasants.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see...[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then I heard the truth
from our commander.[.][A]
One of our generals had[.]
drummed up a fake rebellion[.][A]
to enhance his military career.[.][A]
These people did not want to fight.[.]
They ran at the mere sight of us.[.][A]
Then, the famous wyvern riders[A]
of Bern rained savage death down
upon these innocents.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]
......[A][ToggleMouthMove]
[OpenMidLeft]
My unit tried to stop them.[.][A]
We were all condemned to
die for our treason.[A]
However, our general spread the[.]
story that we were to be hanged[.][A]
for slaughtering innocent lives.[A]
Before they could round us up, we[.]
decided to turn our coats and run.[A]
One of us stayed behind as a decoy,[.]
and the rest fled for the border.[.][A]
After that, we dispersed. All have
been killed now, except for me.[.][A][0x02]
Are you satisfied now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
...I see.[.][.....]
So, Bern...[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Bern is nothing to me...[A]
I have no love for a country
that slaughters its own.[A]
Kent, what about your liege?[A]
Would you give your life
in this lord's service?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Yes.[A]
It is a knight's honor to swear[.]
his fealty and his life.[A]
My happiness is to serve.[.][A][X]

I was born in Edessa.[.][A]
That's where the pegasi gather

I... I am not so good at[A]

of the Ice Dragon?[A][ToggleSmile]

...Ice Dragon?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]

Don't you know the story?[.][A][ToggleSmile]

I've been traveling for a[.]

[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
Oh...I see...[.][A][0x02]
Well, a long time ago, there
was an ice dragon in Ilia.[A]
And this kind dragon helped[.]
the people of Ilia, who had[.][A]
trouble living in snow year round.[A][0x02]
But a war broke out between[.]
dragons and people...[.][A]
And the kind dragons, not[.]
wanting to hurt the humans,[.][A]
went off to a faraway place.[A][ToggleSmile]

My sister first told me that
story as a child to make[A]
me go to bed...[.][A]
Even now, every year,[.]
the people in that area[.][A]
make an offering to[.]
the mountain...[.][A]
When I was little, I so wanted
to meet the ice dragon that[.][A]
I braved the cold and waited all
night next to the place of offering...[A]
But I saw dawn the next morning,
and the dragon never came...[A]
Then I caught a cold and my[.]
sister got very upset with me...[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]
...You waited all night?[A]
Miss Florina... Weren't you[.]
afraid of the dragon?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Afraid? Why?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Doesn't everyone think that dragons[.]
are terrifying, man-eating beasts?[A]
I mean, how could two different[.]
species ever get along?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleSmile]
It doesn't matter what species
you are... Look at me.[A]
My pegasus and I are
of different species...[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidLeft]

Pegasi are all very shy[.]
around humans...[A]
But I'm kind of that way, too...[A]
At first this sweet mare and I
were so afraid of each other...[.][A]

But we played together,[.]

And soon, we began to[.]
understand each other...[A]

So even if two beings may be
shaped a little differently...[A]
That doesn't mean they
can't get along.[A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]The apprentice tactician [.][Tact]
and the young swordfighter Lyn.[.][A]
A strange pair on an even[.]
stranger journey.[.][A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]To prepare for the long road ahead,[.][A]
they go to Bulgar, the commercial[.]
center of Sacae.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Unbeknownst to Lyn, she will discover[.]
something that will alter her life forever.[.][A][X]

# 0x06BD
A small altar lies on the outskirts[.]
of Bulgar.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]This ancient temple, sacred to the people[.]
of Sacae, has long been known for[.][A]
its powerful bond to the world of spirits.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Before starting their journey, our travelers
come here to pray for their well-being.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]At this altar, Lyn's hand is directed[.]
to a grand inheritance.[.][A][X]

# 0x06BE
[LoadOverworldFaces]The secrets of her past revealed in the[.]
words of two Knights of Lycia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, to meet her grandfather, Lyn[.]
heads west,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]to Lycia, and to her destiny.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A mountain range separates the Sacae
Plains from Bern.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]There are many bandits lurking here,
the cruelest of which are the Taliver.[A]
They wreak havoc on both Sacae and Bern,
and their savagery knows no bounds.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]On her tenth day away from the plains,[A]
Lyn witnesses their atrocities herself.[.][A][X]

# 0x06BF
[LoadOverworldFaces]After defeating the bandits, Lyn
continues westward.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]She and her colleagues stop for the[.]
night at a ruined fortress.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Ganelon bandits are in a rage after[.]
their brethren fell to Lyn's swords.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They race in pursuit of the companions.[.][A]
Their angry footsteps sound[.]
closer and closer...[A][X]

# 0x06C0
The next morning comes too quickly.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn has fought back the bandits' attack.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, she rushes for the border of Bern.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]If she can reach it, Lycia itself[.]
is not far off.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]For a moment, Lyn stops to imagine the
face of a grandfather she's never seen.[.][A][X]

# 0x06C1
[LoadOverworldFaces]At long last, Lyn arrives in the land[.]
of her mother's birth.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lycia is a federation of territories, each
one ruled by a powerful marquess.[.][A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, Lyn takes her leave of one of these
territories, Araphen[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]and sets out to meet her grandfather, the[.]
marquess of Caelin.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, the marquess's brother, Lundgren,
hungers to rule Caelin.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He is preparing a deadly welcome for Lyn,[.]
who stands to threaten his grasp for power.[.][A][X]

# 0x06C2
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn takes her leave of Araphen, finding[.]
no aid from its spiteful marquess.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, she and her companions resume
their march toward Caelin in earnest.[.][A]
Racing against time, with her[.]
grandfather's life the prize.[.][A]
Harried and impatient, Lyn
presses onward.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Suddenly a young boy appears
and pleads for their assistance.[A][X]

# 0x06C3
[LoadOverworldFaces]A mysterious group seems hell-bent
on capturing Nils and Ninian...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Having failed, this group, the Black Fang,
flees. Rumor has them traveling southwest.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn and her colleagues follow in hopes
of recovering a lost heirloom.[A]
The Black Fang have made a stronghold[.]
of an abandoned castle in Khathelet.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Its dark halls are alive with shadowy[.]
figures...[A][X]

# 0x06C4
[LoadOverworldFaces]Passing through Araphen and Khathelet,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn and her friends arrive in Caelin.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, Caelin is now under the
rule of Lord Lundgren.[A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lundgren's henchmen lay in wait[.]
to assassinate Lyn.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They wait for her approach and
ready a special weapon.[.][A][X]

# 0x06C5
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn and her friends have been branded[.]
as traitors, pretenders to the throne.[A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lundgren has sent word to Caelin's
neighbors, warning them of Lyn's approach.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He calls for reinforcements to put
an end to the "imposters."[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]If the other realms of Lycia choose to
act, Lyn will never reach Caelin alive.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn places her faith in Eliwood[.]
and waits.[A][X]

# 0x06C6
[LoadOverworldFaces]General Eagler has been defeated.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lyn and her band draw ever nearer[.]
to Castle Caelin.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Within the castle walls, Lyn's bitter[.]
enemy, Lundgren, awaits...[A]
A man who would kill his own
kin for a throne.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He is the source of all her[.]
troubles. He must be stopped.[.][A][X]

# 0x06C7
Once, dragon fought man in
a war called the Scouring...[A]
Mankind vanquished the dragons thanks[.]
to the efforts of eight heroes.[.][A]
These eight mighty generals brought[.]
peace to Elibe.[.][A]
The continent was divided into nations, and[.]
the people enjoyed an easy prosperity.[A][X]

How much longer can this peace stand
before its foundations begin to crumble?[A][X]

# 0x06D0
[LoadOverworldFaces][X]

# 0x06D1
[LoadOverworldFaces]Deep within the Lycian League lies
Pherae, a land that has known no conflict[.][A]
for many generations, but which now finds[.]
itself touched by a shadow of unease.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Its beloved and benevolent ruler, Lord
Elbert, has mysteriously vanished...[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]as have a number of his sworn men,
loyal knights who serve at his side.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A month has passed without word from
the marquess.[.][......] Rumors of his death abound.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, the marquess's son believes his
father lives,[.][......] and he has vowed to find him.[A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Marquess Pherae's son, Eliwood:[.][A]
A red-haired youth who will one day[.]
become the finest knight in all of Lycia.[.][A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]His long journey begins here.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D2
[LoadOverworldFaces]After speaking with the village magistrate,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood and company set their[.]
sights on Laus.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The road from Pherae to Laus passes[.]
through Santaruz.[.][A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood suspects his missing father must
have visited Santaruz en route to Ostia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood arranges a meeting with the local[.]
ruling lord to see what he can learn.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D3
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood enters Santaruz, only to be[.]
attacked by a strange group.[A]
In a desperate moment, he is
rescued by a childhood friend,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Marquess Ostia's younger
brother, Hector.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The assailants' leader reveals that an
unknown party seeks Eliwood's head...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood cannot help but think this is[.]
related to his father's disappearance.[A][0x02]
In search of more traces of his[.]
father's footsteps,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood sets out for the castle of
Lord Helman, the marquess of Santaruz.[A][X]

# 0x06D4
[LoadOverworldFaces]The dying words of Lord Helman[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]stun Eliwood beyond belief.[.][A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]"Darin, the marquess of Laus,[.]
knows all..."[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Despite the pain it brings, Eliwood takes[.]
this newfound knowledge to heart[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]and sets out for Laus once again.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]On the way to Laus, he travels
through a Caelin village.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood and his party decide
to rest there for a night.[A][X]

# 0x06D5
[LoadOverworldFaces]A droll merchant named Merlinus[.]
now joins Eliwood's group.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With Merlinus in tow, they set out
for Laus the following day.[.][A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Laus is located in the heart of Lycia,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]a territory ruled by the power-hungry[.]
marquess of Laus, Lord Darin.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Preparations for the war of which[.]
the Pheraen magistrate spoke...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The disappearance of Eliwood's father,
Elbert...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The death of Marquess Santaruz...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Do these all revolve around[.]
Lord Darin?[.][A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]In Eliwood's heart,[.][......] the need for truth is
drowned in fear...[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A fear of what that truth may hold.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D6
[LoadOverworldFaces]Laus is located in the heart of Lycia,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]a territory ruled by the power-hungry[.]
marquess of Laus, Lord Darin.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Preparations for the war of which[.]

[LoadOverworldFaces]The death of Marquess Santaruz...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Do these all revolve around[.]

[LoadOverworldFaces]In Eliwood's heart,[.][......] the need for truth is

[LoadOverworldFaces]A fear of what that truth may hold.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D7
[LoadOverworldFaces]In Laus, Erik tells Eliwood of a plan.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A plot to use Laus as starting ground[.]
in a rebellion against Ostia.[.][A][0x02]

[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood needs proof to believe
these accusations, and so[.][A]
he and his allies pursue Darin,[.]
the fleeing marquess of Laus.[.][A]
Where that chase would lead,
Eliwood could not have known.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D8
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood and colleagues defeat Bauker,[.]
one of Marquess Laus's lackeys.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They then press on toward Castle Caelin.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Yet inside the castle many Laus[.]
soldiers remain.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood and friends begin their assault on
the castle to save Marquess Caelin.[.][A][X]

# 0x06D9
[LoadOverworldFaces]After speaking with the Ostian spy Leila,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood realizes he must travel to Valor,[.]
the Dread Isle.[.][A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]The small island, located south of Lycia,[.]
is said to be home to the Dragon's Gate.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Heading for the southern coast of Caelin,[.]
they seek passage in the port of Badon.[.][A][X]

# 0x06DA
[LoadOverworldFaces]Fargus's ship sails along smoothly.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]At last, they spot a fog-enshrouded[.]
isle on the horizon.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood's father is on the isle,
as is the Dragon's Gate.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]As they draw closer to the isle,[A]
Eliwood no longer fears that his father[.]
might be one of the conspirators.[.][A]
As the moment of truth nears, Eliwood[.]
only prays that he is safe.[.][A][X]

# 0x06DB
[LoadOverworldFaces]After speaking with the Ostian spy Leila,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood realizes he must travel to Valor,[.]
the Dread Isle.[.][A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]They head straight to the port city[.]
of Badon seeking passage.[.][A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]After a long journey, they spot a[.]
fog-enshrouded isle on the horizon.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood's father is on the isle,
as is the Dragon's Gate.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]As they draw closer to the isle,[A]
Eliwood no longer fears that his father[.]
might be one of the conspirators.[.][A]
As the moment of truth nears, Eliwood[.]
only prays that he is safe.[.][A][X]

# 0x06DC
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood arrives on the shores of Valor
with a new companion in his numbers,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]an enigmatic young girl named Ninian.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The majority of the island is covered[.]
in dense forest.[A]
Legend has it that no one has ever
returned from those dark woods.[.][A]
A dense fog crawls over the party,
engulfing them one by one...[A]
Cautiously, they move deeper into[.]
the trees.[A][X]

# 0x06DD
[LoadOverworldFaces]With Uhai's dying words still sounding
in their ears,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]they venture deep into the forest's heart.[A]
Lyn moves in utmost silence, cautious[.]
not to alert any hidden enemy.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, following on her path,[.][......]
a new Black Fang shadow appears.[A][X]

# 0x06DE
[LoadOverworldFaces]Following Uhai's last words, Eliwood
ventures toward the heart of the forest.[A][0x02]
He is greeted by an extraordinary sight.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A building unlike any he's ever seen.[.]
It was clearly not wrought by human hands...[A]
It is waiting...waiting for the masters[.]
who abandoned it centuries past.[A]
Massive beyond belief, these ancient
ruins have nothing to do with humankind.[A]
Eliwood has arrived.
He has found the Dragon's Gate.[.][A][X]

# 0x06DF
[LoadOverworldFaces]At last, Eliwood's long-awaited reunion[.]
with his father,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]as well as their painful farewell.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]After escaping the Dread Isle, they[.]
return to the port city of Badon.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood remains silent for the duration[.]
of their passage.[.][A]
He sits cradling his father's cold hand[.]
as if to warm him back to life.[.][A][X]

# 0x06E0
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood travels westward to meet with[.]
Uther, the marquess of Ostia.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They pass through Laus and
continue through two more territories.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]After a time, they arrive at a fortress[.]
separating Thria and Ostia.[.][A][X]

# 0x06E1
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Nabata Desert[.][A][X]

# 0x06E2
[LoadOverworldFaces]A wasteland of scorching sun
and frigid nights.[A]
It rejects human life.[A]
Any careless enough to enter its
embrace is doomed to wander lost.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Uther, the marquess of Ostia,[.]
spoke of a living legend...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Guided by his words, Eliwood
heads straight into the desert.[.][A][X]

# 0x06E3
[LoadOverworldFaces]Heeding the archsage Athos's advice,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood sets out for Bern.[A][X]

# 0x06E4
[LoadOverworldFaces]Bern: the greatest military force[.]

# 0x06E5
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Lycian League has always enjoyed
close relations with the kingdom of Bern.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Recently, however, King Desmond has[.]
begun to flaunt his military strength.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lycian nobles can no longer move
freely within Bern's borders.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood and his group enter the[.]
country in the guise of simple travelers.[.][A][X]

# 0x06E6
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Bern royal family is a pageant
of power, love, and hate.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood finds himself embroiled[.]
in their troubles.[A]
He has been sent to recover the[.]
Bern family treasure: the Fire Emblem.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It has been stolen from the[.]
palace vault.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood enters the royal palace[.]
seeking clues.[A][X]

# 0x06E7
[LoadOverworldFaces]They follow the Black Fang
due south.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Although the trail vanishes, Lyn uses her[.]
tracking skills, and the pursuit continues.[.][A]
The path leads up into Bern's[.]
impassable mountains.[.][A]
The peaks know no seasons, and the
snow covers all in a bright blanket.[A]
In this land of blinding reflections,[.]
an ancient castle appears.[A][X]

# 0x06E8
[LoadOverworldFaces]Two assassins in the employ of
the Black Fang move in.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They've been set loose in the palace
to murder the crown prince, Zephiel.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood hurries to prevent them from
fulfilling their contract.[A][X]

# 0x06E9
[LoadOverworldFaces]Jaffar and Nino,
Black Fang assassins.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Befriended by Eliwood, they've now
joined his group.[.][A]
That night...[.][A][X]

# 0x06EA
[LoadOverworldFaces]After receiving aid from
Queen Hellene,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood rushes to the[.]
sealed shrine.[A]
The secret road they follow[.]
is known only to the royal family...[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They pass Bern's soldiers[.]
unnoticed and unhindered.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They approach the castle...[.][A][X]

# 0x06EB
[LoadOverworldFaces]A mountain cave on the outskirts
of Ostia.[.][A]
Here, a sacred weapon lies waiting,[.]
the seal guarding it broken.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, to retrieve the weapon,
one must pass a trial.[A]
A long, seemingly uncrossable[.]
distance...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood must overcome the challenge[.]
with the help of his friends.[.][A]
Eliwood's true strength will soon[.]
be sorely tested.[.][A][X]

# 0x06EC
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ninian is dead.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Now, only Nergal's echoing
laughter remains...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]On Hector's advice, the[.]
group heads toward Ostia.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They are weary to the bone, and[.]
they need time to regroup.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ostia is the most heavily guarded[.]
fortress city in all of Lycia.[A]
No enemy should have been[.]
able to breach its walls.[.][A][X]

# 0x06ED
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood struggles to recover from[.]
Ninian's death and moves onward.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]His destination is the Dread Isle.[A]
An enemy waits there, one who[.]
must be defeated.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Nergal surrounds himself with his[.]
morphs and waits for Eliwood's arrival.[.][A]
The final battle draws near...[A][X]

# 0x06EE
[LoadOverworldFaces]A month has passed since word came
of Marquess Pherae's disappearance.[.][A]
Rumors and speculation run rampant
throughout Lycia.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The head of House Ostia, Lord[.]
Uther, takes no apparent interest.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The marquess's younger brother
is considered odd by the populace.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He and Marquess Pherae's son,[.]
Eliwood, are fast friends.[A]
A hot-blooded youth, he cannot
ignore his friend's plight.[.][A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Marquess Ostia's younger brother, Hector.[.][A]
He would one day be a courageous
general, a steel warrior to be feared.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The path he chooses will test him to
the limits of his strength.[.][A][X]

# 0x06EF
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector leaves Ostia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He moves toward Santaruz to meet
up with Eliwood as quickly as possible.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He encounters a mysterious group whose
dark garb hide an even darker secret.[.][A]
Perhaps these same powers have [.]
turned their blades on Eliwood...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector hurries south,[.]
praying for his friend's safety.[A][X]

# 0x06F0
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector rescues Eliwood,[.][A]
and the two friends are reunited.[.][A][0x02]

[LoadOverworldFaces]The paladin Marcus reveals news:[A]
Someone has called for Eliwood's death.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Pherae's problems must be connected[.]
to the attempt on Eliwood's life.[.][A]
Searching for more clues,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector and friends depart for[.]
the castle of Marquess Santaruz.[A][X]

# 0x06F1
[LoadOverworldFaces]The dying words of Lord Helman, the[.]
marquess of Santaruz...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]only serve to strengthen
Hector's convictions.[.][A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]"Darin, the marquess of Laus,[.]
knows all..."[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]To ascertain the truth of what he's[.]
heard, Hector departs for Laus.[.][A][0x02]

To reach Laus from Santaruz,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector's group must pass through
a village in Caelin.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They decide to rest there[.]
for the night.[A][X]

# 0x06F2
[LoadOverworldFaces]A droll merchant named Merlinus[.]
now joins Hector's group.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]With Merlinus in tow, Hector sets[.]
out for Laus the following day.[.][A][0x02]

[LoadOverworldFaces]Laus is located in the heart of Lycia,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]a territory ruled by the power-hungry[.]
marquess of Laus, Lord Darin.[.][A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]According to information gathered[.]
by Ostia's network of spies,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Darin was definitely involved[.]
in Marquess Pherae's disappearance.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Despite strong opposition, Hector[.]
is determined to uncover the truth.[.][A][X]

# 0x06F3
[LoadOverworldFaces]Laus is located in the heart of Lycia,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]a territory ruled by the power-hungry[.]
marquess of Laus, Lord Darin.[.][A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]According to information gathered[.]

[LoadOverworldFaces]Darin was definitely involved[.]
in Marquess Pherae's disappearance.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Despite strong opposition, Hector[.]
is determined to uncover the truth.[.][A][X]

# 0x06F4
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector and his companions[.]
defeat Marquess Laus's son, Erik,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]and seize Castle Laus.[A]
After the battle, they rest in the
castle and settle their affairs.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They diligently prepare for any[.]
possible counterattack.[.][A]
They should've spotted anyone[.]
attempting to approach the castle.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]And yet, somehow, they find themselves
facing an unforeseen attack...[A][X]

# 0x06F5
[LoadOverworldFaces]After repelling the mercenary[.]
forces of Eubans,[.][A]
Hector prepares to mount a
pursuit of Marquess Laus.[.][A][0x02]

[LoadOverworldFaces]Lord Darin and his knights[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]are with the instigator of the
rebellion, the enigmatic Ephidel.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector learns where the fugitives were
traveling from Ostia's network of spies.[A]
However, their final destination still
remains unknown...[A][X]

# 0x06F6
[LoadOverworldFaces]Near Laus, Hector defeats[.]
General Bauker.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector and his allies now march[.]
toward Castle Caelin.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, many Laus soldiers[.]
await them inside.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]They begin their assault to[.]
liberate the castle.[A][X]

# 0x06F7
[LoadOverworldFaces]After speaking with the Ostian spy Leila,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]the group decides they must[.]
travel to Valor, the Dread Isle.[A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]The small island, located south of Lycia,[.]
is said to be home to the Dragon's Gate.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Heading for the southern coast of Caelin,[.]
they seek passage in the port of Badon.[.][A][X]

# 0x06F8
[LoadOverworldFaces]Fargus's ship sails along smoothly.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]At last, they spot a fog-enshrouded[.]
isle on the horizon.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]According to Leila's information,[.]
the enemy is gathering there.[.][A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Darin, the marquess of Laus,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]the Black Fang assassins,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]the mysterious Nergal,
and his henchman, Ephidel.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]As the island draws closer, Hector
hears death whispering on the wind.[.][A][X]

# 0x06F9
[LoadOverworldFaces]After speaking with the Ostian spy Leila,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]the group decides they must[.]
travel to Valor, the Dread Isle.[A]

[LoadOverworldFaces]They head straight to the port city[.]
of Badon seeking passage.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]After a long journey, they spot a[.]
fog-enshrouded isle on the horizon.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]According to Leila's information,[.]
the enemy is gathering there.[.][A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Darin, the marquess of Laus,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]the Black Fang assassins,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]the mysterious Nergal,
and his henchman, Ephidel.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]As the island draws closer, Hector
hears death whispering on the wind.[.][A][X]

# 0x06FA
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector arrives on the shores of Valor[.]
with a new companion in his numbers,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]an enigmatic young girl named Ninian.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The majority of the island is covered[.]
in dense forest.[A]
Legend has it that no one has ever
returned from those dark woods.[.][A]
A dense fog crawls over the party,
engulfing them one by one...[A]
Cautiously, they move deeper into[.]
the trees.[A][X]

# 0x06FB
[LoadOverworldFaces]With Uhai's dying words still sounding
in their ears,[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]they venture deep into the forest's heart.[A]
Lyn moves in utmost silence, cautious[.]
not to alert any hidden enemy.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, following on her path,[.][......]
a new Black Fang shadow appears.[A][X]

# 0x06FC
[LoadOverworldFaces]All of their battles have led them here.[A]
Now, at long last, they've finally
reached the Dragon's Gate.[A]
Hector gains a brief respite
before the decisive battle.[.][A]
Shortly thereafter, he notices
something...[A][0x02]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Ninian has gone missing.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]There! Her pale figure vanishes into the
dark woods, her gait is unsteady,[.][A]
as though she were possessed.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector quicky gives chase.[A][X]

# 0x06FD
[LoadOverworldFaces]Following Uhai's last words, Hector[.]
ventures toward the heart of the forest.[A][0x02]
He is greeted by an extraordinary sight.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]A building unlike any he's ever seen.[.]
It was clearly not wrought by human hands...[A]
It is waiting...waiting for the masters[.]
who abandoned it centuries past.[A]
Massive beyond belief, these ancient
ruins have nothing to do with humankind.[A]
Hector has arrived.[.]
He has found the Dragon's Gate.[.][A][X]

# 0x06FE
[LoadOverworldFaces]They find the man for whom they've
been searching, Marquess Pherae.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]He breathes his last in the[.]
embrace of his son, Eliwood.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]The companions leave the Dragon's[.]
Gate and set sail for Badon.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood is grief-stricken[.]
at his father's death.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector can find no words
to comfort his friend.[A][X]

# 0x06FF
[LoadOverworldFaces]The group travels west to meet with[.]
Lord Uther, the marquess of Ostia.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Lord Uther is an intelligent leader[.]
and power in the Lycian League.[.][A]
He has also been a father to Hector, ever[.]
since their parents died many years ago.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector's reunion with his brother is
a happy one, if somewhat embarrassing.[A]
Hector continues his journey filled[.]
with complex emotions.[A]
At length, they arrive at a fortress
that separates Thria and Ostia.[.][X]

# 0x0700
[LoadOverworldFaces]The Nabata Desert.[A][X]

# 0x0701
[LoadOverworldFaces]A wasteland of scorching sun
and frigid nights.[A]
It rejects human life.[A]
Any careless enough to enter its
embrace is doomed to wander lost.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Uther, the marquess of Ostia,[.]
spoke of a living legend...[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Guided by his words, Hector[.]
heads straight into the desert.[.][A][X]

# 0x0702

[LoadOverworldFaces]The Bern royal family is a pageant

[LoadOverworldFaces]Eliwood finds himself embroiled[.]

He has been sent to recover the[.]
Bern family treasure: the Fire Emblem.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]It has been stolen from the[.]
palace vault.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Relying on information that[.]
he has uncovered in the city,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector heads south to an area[.]
filled with lakes and marshes.[A][X]

# 0x0706
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector and his allies defeat[.....]
[LoadOverworldFaces]the Black Fang monster, Pascal.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, they learn nothing of
the Fire Emblem's location.[.][A]
To escape from the Black Fang, they[.]
disguise themselves once more.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]At Eliwood's suggestion, they[.]
head for the royal palace of Bern.[A][X]

# 0x0707
[LoadOverworldFaces]They follow the Black Fang
due south.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Although the trail vanishes, Lyn uses her[.]
tracking skills, and the pursuit continues.[.][A]
The path leads up into Bern's[.]
impassable mountains.[.][A]
The peaks know no seasons, and the
snow covers all in a bright blanket.[A]
In this land of blinding reflections,[.]
an ancient castle appears.[A][X]

# 0x0708

[LoadOverworldFaces]Although Hector cannot forget his hatred
for Nergal's former henchman, Jaffar,[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Hector allows him to join the group,
with Nino at his side.[A][0x02]
That night...[.][A][X]

# 0x070A

# 0x070B
[LoadOverworldFaces]To the west of Elibe lies an
archipelago known as the Western Isles.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]Here, a sacred weapon lies waiting,[.]
the seal guarding it broken.[A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]However, to retrieve the weapon,
one must pass a trial.[A]

Armads, a sacred axe filled with the
destructive force of thunder.[.][A]
[LoadOverworldFaces]To wield it, one must prove[.]
one's worth.[A]
Hector faces a test unlike any
he's ever experienced.[A][X]

# 0x070C

[LoadOverworldFaces]What could they be?[.]

you let that heal.[A]
Do you understand?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]I'm truly sorry...
I've been useless.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I never want to hear

that female swordfighter?[.][A]
Karla, wasn't it?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It seems she was hurt in
that last skirmish.[.][A]

I'm... I'll be fine...[A]

# 0x07FF
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xB6][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft]
Your group moves like lightning.[A]
You must have an expert[.]
tactician giving you direction.[.][A]
I'd love to study under someone[.]
like that.[A][X]

# 0x0800
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xB6][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft]
One of the main rules of
combat is never to rush.[A]
It looks like your tactician
knows that well.[A][X]

# 0x0801
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xB6][0x01][OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft]
It's good that you know not to
race into a fight.[A]
But don't waste your opportunities
being overcautious.[.][A][X]

# 0x0802
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xAD][0x01]
Ah, a traveler, are you? Well,
you should know something...[A]
We've had some odd sightings
around here lately...[.][A]
A man in an ill-seeming robe
has been visiting the castle.[.][A]
His eyes are cruel things,
filled with an awful malice![A]
Oh, it's too terrible for words![A][X]

# 0x0803
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xB2][0x01]
Are you one of Eliwood's soldiers?
You have that look about you.[.][A]
The villagers are saying that you can[.]
defeat an enemy in the blink of an eye.[.][A]
When I get older, I'm going to be that
swift! Just you wait and see![.][A][X]

especially rigorous.[A][X]

Are you supposed to be
a mercenary?[A]
Looks like you've got nothing but[.]
a bunch of raw recruits with you![.][A]
Maybe you should let them[.]
experience combat firsthand![A][X]

# 0x080A
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xAB][0x01]

likely [.][ToggleRed]miss you[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
However, your attacks[.]
will be unimpeded, giving[.]
you a distinct advantage.[.][A][0x02]
The same is true for foes.[.....]
If an enemy is in the[.]
woods, he is more[.]
[ToggleRed]difficult to hit[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
Factoring in your terrain[.]
benefits and the weapon[.]
[ToggleRed]triangle[ToggleRed] is vital in combat.[A][0x02]
The [ToggleRed]window[ToggleRed] at the [ToggleRed]bottom[ToggleRed]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x1A][0x01][ToggleSmile]
It seems like a wise
decision to leave that[A]
bandit to the knights.[.....][A][X]

# 0x0862
For my part, if I'm going to
take care of the other foe,[.][A]
I'll need to close the
distance between us.[A]
The knight said that woods
are advantageous, right?[A]
In that case...[.][A][X]

# 0x0863
That looks good. Let's move[.]
there, [.][Tact]![.][A][X]

[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x30][0x01]
Yes! Sain, the gallant

If you insist...
Why have you not healed yourself?[.][A]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x30][0x01]
Huh? [.][.....]Hey! I've[.]
been injured?[.][A][CloseSpeechFast]
What a cad I am![A]
To wrinkle that perfect brow

[ToggleSmile][OpenFarRight]
Uh...[.][A]
I was thinking of giving you
a vulnerary, but...[.][A][0x02]
It looks like you're fine.
So, never you mind.[.][A][ClearFace]
[ToggleSmile][OpenMidLeft]
No, wait! I'll take it![.]
Please! I'll take it!![A][X]

# 0x0865
To give away an item,[.]
use the [ToggleRed]trade[.][ToggleRed]
command.[A][0x02]
[ToggleRed]Trade[.][ToggleRed] can only be used[.]
by units that are[.]
adjacent to one another.[A][0x02]
Let's use the [ToggleRed]trade[.][ToggleRed]
command now.[.....]
Select Sain and move him
next to Lyn.[A][.....][X]

# 0x0866
I can't keep such a[.]

Hurry, [.][Tact]! Hurry![A][X]

# 0x0868
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x30][0x01]
I must use the vulnerary
and put my lady's mind at ease![.][A]
[Tact]! Bring me to her![A][X]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x30][0x01]
I mustn't worry my lady[.]

Come, [Tact]! Direct me to her![.][A][X]

Move me next to her!
I implore you![A][X]

# 0x086B
Move me next to her!
Heed my wishes![.][A][X]

# 0x086C
Now select the [.][ToggleRed]trade[.][ToggleRed]
command. Sain's and Lyn's[.]
possessions will be[.]
displayed together.[.][A][0x02]
Use the cursor to select
a [ToggleRed]vulnerary[.][ToggleRed] from Lyn's[.]
items, and give it to[.]
[ToggleRed]Sain[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
After you've finished your
[ToggleRed]trade[.][ToggleRed], press the[.]
[ToggleRed]B Button[ToggleRed] to[.]
end the process.[A][0x02]
The [ToggleRed]B Button[ToggleRed] is the[.]
[ToggleRed]cancel button[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
It can be used to rescind[.][.....]
mistaken commands[.][.....]
and other things.[.][A][.....][X]

# 0x086D
Sain can now [.][ToggleRed]use[.][ToggleRed]
Lyn's [ToggleRed]vulnerary[.][ToggleRed].[.][.....]
Select the [.][ToggleRed]vulnerary[.][ToggleRed] from[.]

# 0x086E
Furthermore, [.][ToggleRed]mounted units[.][ToggleRed]
have the unique ability to
[ToggleRed]move again[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
Essentially, this allows
cavalry to move the[.]
[ToggleRed]number of spaces
left in their movement
range[.][ToggleRed] if they haven't[A]
done so already.[A][0x02]
However, the [.][ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed]
command, among others,
nullifies the [ToggleRed]move again[ToggleRed]
ability, so be careful.[.][A][0x02]
Select Sain and order[.]
him to [.][ToggleRed]move[ToggleRed] again.[.][A][.....][X]

To open the [ToggleRed]map[.]

[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x16][0x01][OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x30][0x01]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x2F][0x01]
Yes.[A]
We have ventured from Caelin,[.]
in Lycia, in search of someone.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Lycia... That's the country beyond
the mountains in the southwest, isn't it?[.][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Correct. We've come as messengers[.]
to the lady Madelyn, [.][.....]who eloped[A]
with a nomad some 19 years ago.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]Madelyn?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Our lord the marquess of Caelin's[.]
only daughter.[A]
He was heartbroken his own
daughter would abandon him so.[A]
Eventually, the marquess simply[.]
declared that he had no daughter.[.][A][X]

# 0x0877
[OpenLeft]
And then this year, we received[.]
a letter from Lady Madelyn.[.][A][CloseSpeechFast]
It said that she, her husband,[A]
and their daughter were living
happily on the Sacae plains.[A][ToggleSmile]
The marquess was ecstatic to learn
he had a granddaughter of 18 years.[.][A]
I remember the smile on his[.]
face when he announced[A]
that he'd suddenly become[.]
a grandfather.[A][0x02]
The granddaughter's name
is Lyndis.[A]
This was also the name
of the marquess's wife,[.][A]
who passed away[.]
at an early age.[A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenMidRight]
Lyndis?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[OpenLeft]
That she should bear this name
thawed the marquess's heart.[A][0x02]
Now, his only wish is to meet his[.]
daughter's family at least once.[A]
This is why we're here.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
We didn't know that Lady
Madelyn died a few days after[.][A]
sending her letter...[.][A][CloseSpeechFast]
We only learned this shortly after
we arrived here in Bulgar.[A][X]

# 0x0878
[OpenFarLeft]
But we also learned all was not lost.[.]
Her daughter yet lives.[.][A]
We heard that she was living
alone on the plains...[A][0x02]
I... I knew it immediately.[.]
You are the lady Lyndis.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Why would you[.]
think that...[.][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Your resemblance to your
departed mother is remarkable.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What? Did you know my mother?[.][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
I'm sorry to say I never
met her directly, but[.][A]
I saw her portraits in Castle Caelin.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
To the rest of my tribe,
I was always Lyn.[.][A]
But when I was with[.]
my parents...[.][A]
When it was just the three
of us, I was Lyndis.[A][0x02][CloseEyes]
It's all so strange.[A]
I was all alone in the world,[.]
and now I have a [.][.....]grandfather.[A][.....]
Lyndis... I never thought I[.]
would hear that name again.[.][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

Wait![.][A]
That bandit! He called me[.]
Lyndis, too![A]
[OpenFarLeft]
What?[.][.....]
How could he have--[.][A]
[OpenLeft]
...He was a henchman of[.]
Lord Lundgren, wasn't he?[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Lundgren?[.][.....]
Who's that?[.][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
He's the marquess's younger brother.[A]
Everyone assumed the lady[.]
Madelyn was gone forever.[.][A]
This made Lord Lundgren[.]
heir to the marquess's title.[.][A]
[OpenLeft]
To be blunt, milady,[A]
your existence is an obstacle to
your granduncle's ambitions.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
That's-- But I have no interest[.]
in inheriting any title![A]
[OpenLeft]
Unfortunately, your granduncle is[.]
not the sort of man to believe that.[A]
I believe the attempts on your
life will persist.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What should I do?[.][A][X]

# 0x087A
[OpenFarLeft]
Accompany us to Caelin.[.][.....]
Continuing on this way is dangerous.[A]

I feel I have little choice.[.....]
I will go with you.[.][A][X]

There is a sacred sword enshrined[.]

The people of Sacae go there

of a long journey.[A]

The Mani Katti is a sacred blade,[.]
under divine protection.[A]

You're a fool, old man.[.][A]
What good's a sword if

You might be able to create another[.]

# 0x089F
You should know something[.]
about [ToggleRed]fortresses[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
[ToggleRed]Fortresses[ToggleRed] offer more[.]
protection than woods do.[.][.....]
Fighting from a space in
a fortress is beneficial.[.][A][0x02]
Remember, this holds true[.]
for friend and foe alike.[.][.....]
Keep this in mind before
engaging your enemy.[A][0x02]
[ToggleRed]Fortresses[ToggleRed] also allow[.]
injured units to regain[.]
hit points.[.][A][0x02]
Your units automatically
regain some HP at the[.]
[ToggleRed]beginning of your turn[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
The HP you [.][ToggleRed]recover[.][ToggleRed] in[.]
one turn is fairly small.[.][A]
As long as you remain in
a [ToggleRed]fortress[ToggleRed], you'll regain[.]
HP [.][ToggleRed]every turn[ToggleRed], so a
full recovery is possible.[A][0x02]
There are other places
where units can [ToggleRed]recover[.]
HP[ToggleRed], including [ToggleRed]castle
gates[.][ToggleRed], [ToggleRed]thrones[.][ToggleRed], and areas[.]
where bosses are found.[.][A][.....][X]

Attacking enemies without[.]

Are you unwell?[.][A][ToggleSmile]
[SendToBack][OpenRight]
I'm sorry, Wil.[.][.....]
Her name is Florina.[A]
She's timid around men,[.]

[OpenFarRight]
Oh! I see![.....]
You must be a pegasus knight![.][A]
I apologize for frightening you, but
I do understand your fear of bows.[A][ToggleSmile]

I...um...[.][ToggleMouthMove]

Those greedy monsters?
We're nothing like them!![.][A]
Those fiends will even kill[.]
women and children![.][A]
We're from Ganelon, and we
know a little something of[A]

Heh heh heh.[A]
After all, why kill what
you can sell?[.][A][ClearFace]

Can we...[.][A]
Can we just stop
fighting now?[.][A][ClearFace]

It's just... I've always dreamt[.]

I will not be so wasteful![A]

You're right, Carjiga!

There's supposed to be a woman

If you want gold, you'll

goal is to protect a

a set period of time.[.][A][0x02]
[ToggleRed]Keep Natalie safe[.]
for 7 turns.[ToggleRed][A][0x02]
[Tact], Natalie,
and other green units[.]
are called [.][ToggleRed]NPCs[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
[ToggleRed]NPCs[ToggleRed] are not
enemies, but they cannot
be moved or given[.]
orders.[.][A][0x02]
Sometimes, green units
will be attacked because
they are on the field[.]

Be careful [.][ToggleRed]not to

# 0x08E5
When the enemy far
outnumbers your group,[A]
it's safer to restrict
the battle to smaller[.]
areas.[A][0x02]
No matter how strong
an enemy is, if he's
attacked on all sides,
he's sure to take[.]
massive damage.[.][A][0x02]
So, [ToggleRed]the east door[.][ToggleRed] is[.]
[ToggleRed]Lyn's[.][ToggleRed], and [ToggleRed]the south[.]

Sometimes, you can
speak with enemy
characters.[.][A][0x02]
If you think you can
converse with someone,
move one of your units

By and large, you'll

Do you remember[.]
the weapon triangle?[.....]
[ToggleRed]Axes[ToggleRed] are [.][ToggleRed]strong
against lances[ToggleRed] and [.][ToggleRed]weak

Axes have [ToggleRed]more power[ToggleRed]
than other weapons, but[.][A]
they are also [ToggleRed]more

Try using Dorcas to[.]
attack.[.][.....]
Select Dorcas now.[A][.....][X]

# 0x08EF

So you're their tactician...[A][0x02]
I'll use my axes and fight

Direct me as you will.[A][X]

# 0x08F0
The weapon Dorcas[.]
is wielding is called a[.]

Use it to attack an[.]
adjacent opponent,[.....]
or throw it in [.][ToggleRed]indirect
combat[ToggleRed] in the manner
of a [.][ToggleRed]bow[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
This versatility makes
it a valuable weapon.[.][A][0x02]
It's difficult to hit with,[.]
though,[.][.....] so don't rely
on it too much.[.][A][0x02]
Now let's use the[.]

# 0x08F1
Right now, after all of[.]

Erk, [.][ToggleRed]a mage[ToggleRed], and[.]
Serra, [.][ToggleRed]a cleric[ToggleRed],[.]
have joined your group.[.][A][0x02]
[ToggleRed]Mages[.][ToggleRed] use the
[ToggleRed]magic[.][ToggleRed] of [ToggleRed]truth[.][ToggleRed]
to attack and damage
their enemies.[A][0x02]
[ToggleRed]Clerics[.][ToggleRed] use [.][ToggleRed]staves[ToggleRed]
to [.][ToggleRed]restore HP[ToggleRed] to[.]
their allies.[.][A][0x02]
Let's try them both.
First, select Serra.[A][.....][X]

"Master," I suppose you could say.[A]
What I'm getting at is... I was thinking
of healing him free of charge.[A][CloseEyes][0x02]
I know, I know. I'm[.]

Hm? Why are you looking at me[.]

Please direct me to him.[A][X]

# 0x0913
I'm going to use my staff.
Watch in wonder![A][X]

# 0x0914
My staff! Let me
use my staff![.][A][X]

# 0x0915
Clerics cannot wield
weapons; therefore
they can't engage[.]
in combat.[A][0x02]
However, they can use[.]
their [ToggleRed]staves[ToggleRed] to[.]
[ToggleRed]restore HP[ToggleRed] to[.]
allied units.[.][A][0x02]
Besides [ToggleRed]healing staves[ToggleRed],[.]
which restore HP, there[.]
are other [ToggleRed]staves[ToggleRed]
with different abilities.[.][A][0x02]
It's always a good idea[.]
to test out any new[.]
abilities you receive,
so let's do that now.[.][A][0x02]
Have Erk demonstrate
his magic. Begin by[.]
selecting Erk.[A][.....][X]

# 0x0916
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x38][0x01]
You are [Tact]? I am Erk.[.][.....]
I'm not sure how I got in this mess.[A][0x02]
If I'm going to fight, however,[.][.....]
I will show you the true power of magic![A][X]

# 0x0917
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x38][0x01]
I will show you the true power of magic![A][X]

# 0x0918
[ToggleRed]Magic[.][ToggleRed], like Dorcas's[.]
throwing axes, [.][ToggleRed]can strike
enemies in adjacent[.]
squares as well as those
at a distance[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
It's very useful.[.][A][0x02]
[ToggleRed]Magic can penetrate even
the strongest defenses[ToggleRed],[.]
so it can be used in
many situations.[A][0x02]
However, [.][ToggleRed]mages have
few HP and low defensive
abilites[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
To avoid counter-[.]
attacks,[.....] move in close
to archers, and attack
other fighters from[.]
1 space away.[.][A][0x02]
Try and formulate combat
strategies like this to[.]
be successful on the
field of combat.[A][.....][X]

Secret passageway?[A]

The final trigger.[A]
If I just press this...[.][A][X]

# 0x0961

OK. This is the[.]

This should do
the trick.[A][X]

# 0x0962

That should do it, then.[A][X]

The marquess of Araphen's hatred for
the people of Sacae is well known.[A]
Nomads are barred entrance to the[.]
city on the marquess's orders. [.][A]
He says he will not allow the nomads'[.]
stench to infect his city.[A]
Long ago, the marquess was in love
with Marquess Caelin's daughter.[A]
It's said she spurned him in favor
of a nomadic prince.[A]
Even so, I think the marquess goes too
far in his treatment of the horsemen.[.][A][X]

# 0x096E
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0xFF][0xFF][OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0xB6][0x01]
So what's your weapon[.]
of choice?[A]
Swords, lances, spears?[.][.....] Or do you
favor bows or magic?[.....] Staves?[A]
Whatever it may be, the more you
use it, the more skilled you become.[A]
Swinging your sword about will
allow you to master it.[.][A]
Eventually, you'll be able to wield[.]
weapons of greater power.[.][A]
It's as they say: Practice

The captain of the marquess's[.]
guard is a fellow named Rath...[.][A]
I've heard tell that he's a nomad[.]
from the plains of Sacae.[.][A]
Odd, considering how the marquess[.]
so obviously hates the nomads.[A]
I guess the marquess is pleased to
have a nomad under his control.[.][A]
The ways of aristocrats are[.]
beyond my comprehension.[A][X]

vanish after being used.[A]
Give them to the people[.]

it, or you'll never use them.[.][A]

An armorslayer![.][A]
Just as the name suggests,[A]
armorslayers are useful against[.]
knights in armor.[.][A]
You want to know something?[.][A]
You need to give weapons to[.]
those who can wield them.[.][A]
Otherwise, it's just a waste
of a perfectly good weapon.[.][A]
Take this blade. I mean, I
can use it, but...[A]
I'm not too strong, and...I just
hate being counterattacked.[.][A]
Anyway, think strategically about[.]
who you give weapons to.[A][X]

# 0x0973
If you get a weapon or
staff you can't use, don't
worry. Other members
of your party might be
able to wield them.[.][A][0x02]
Items you cannot use
appear in gray text. Try
trading these items to

My name's Lucius.[.][A]

I was at the inn when this child

The innkeeper was afraid

The [ToggleRed]monk[ToggleRed] Lucius[.]
has joined your group.[.....]
Monks are users of the
[ToggleRed]magic of light[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
Those who wield magic[.]
are highly attuned to[.]
its flow, so they have
a high [.][ToggleRed]magic resistance[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
Units with high magic[.]
resistances can reduce
the damage caused[.]
by magical attacks.[.][A][0x02]
When magic users battle[.]
each other, they often
find it hard to inflict[.]
damage.[.][A][0x02]
The [ToggleRed]light magic[.][ToggleRed] of[.]
monks is [.][ToggleRed]strong[ToggleRed] against
the [ToggleRed]dark magic[ToggleRed] favored
by [.][ToggleRed]shamans[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
Lucius should come
in handy here.[A][0x02]

This is no place for

# 0x098C
It's time to see what[.]
Nils can do.[A][0x02]
The [ToggleRed]music[.][ToggleRed] played by
[ToggleRed]bards[.][ToggleRed] allows your

You ought to play for me sometime.
I could use the boost![A]

# 0x0991
Through the power[.]
of Nils's [ToggleRed]music[.][ToggleRed],[.][.....]
Lucius can move again[.]

Bards gain experience[.]

So how much do you
know about magic, huh?[A][A]
Magical attacks are special.[A]
You can't just avoid 'em
like a sword or an axe.[.][A]
Not even if you're wearing armor.[.][A]
Who's tough against magic?
Let me think...[.][A]
Well, anyone who uses[.]
magic or staves.[A]
Pegasus knights, too.[.][A][0x02]
Hm? You got others who need[.]
to battle magic users?[A]
I got something for 'em.
It's a special kind of water.[.][A]
"Pure water," it's called.
Just sprinkle a bit on you.[.][A]
It'll protect you and lessen
the damage you take a bit.[A]
Go on, take it.[.][A]
Don't be so shy. It's not like
I'm givin' you gold or anything.[A]
This stuff's strongest when you[.]
first put it on.[A]
It gets weaker as time passes,
so be careful.[A][X]

Pay me no mind. I was just
thinking out loud.[A]
You see, there's an old tree on the[.]

It's just a dead old snag, really.[A]

Lord Lundgren is getting serious.[.][A]
Deploying siege engines is
no mean feat.[.][A]
[OpenRight]
What is a ballista?[.][A]
[OpenLeft]
It's a weapon designed for
long-distance attacks.[A]
Only archers can use them,
but they can be devastating.[A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Florina![OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x33][0x01][OpenFarLeft]
You must stay aground![A]
Do not take to the air![.][A]
The ballista would target[.]
you in an instant.[A][OpenFarRight][MoveFarRight][ClearFace]
[OpenRight]
Is there a way to combat it?[A]
[OpenLeft]
The safest course is to use[.][A]
someone with good defense as
bait, so the enemy wastes arrows.[.][A]
[OpenFarLeft]
Then you can walk up and knock
the fool on the head.[.][A][ClearFace][OpenLeft][ClearFace][X]

It's just a really big bow, right?
I should be able to figure it out.[A]
[OpenRight]
All we can ask is that you try...[.][A][0x02]
Let's see what we can do![.][A][X]

# 0x09B7
[OpenRight]
It's a giant bow?[.]
If only Wil were here...[A][0x02]
All we can do is
try. Let's go![A][X]

# 0x09B8
On the far side of the hill[.]
to the south is a [ToggleRed]ballista[ToggleRed].[.][.....]
As Kent said, it's a
weapon intended for[.]
trained [ToggleRed]archers[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
The [ToggleRed]attack range[ToggleRed] of[.]
[ToggleRed]ballistae[.][ToggleRed] is extremely[.]
large,[.....] so they can fire on
enemies at great
distances.[A][0x02]
As they can attack
without fear of[.]
counterattack, they're
quite useful.[.][A][0x02]
To use one, move an[.]
[ToggleRed]archer[ToggleRed] onto an
[ToggleRed]unoccupied ballista[.][ToggleRed],[.][.....]
and select the [.][ToggleRed]ride[ToggleRed]
command.[A][0x02]
After that, you can[.]
[ToggleRed]attack[ToggleRed] as usual.[A]
[ToggleRed]Ballistae[.][ToggleRed] can also be
[ToggleRed]moved while in use[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
Additionally, [ToggleRed]ballistae[.][ToggleRed] can
be used by any archer[.]
in the field.[.][A][0x02]
So, if you can remove[.]
the enemy manning the[.]
[ToggleRed]ballista[ToggleRed] and move[.]
one of your group onto it...[.....]
you'll find it most useful.[.][A][.....][X]

[ToggleRed]Axes over lances[ToggleRed] and whatnot?[.][A]
This is important, so[.]
pay attention.[A]
There are some weapons that[.]
don't follow the normal rules.[A]
This here [ToggleRed]lancereaver[.][ToggleRed] is one of those.[.][A]
It's a [.][ToggleRed]sword that reverses the triangle[ToggleRed].[.][A]
So if you wield this blade, you[.]
can [ToggleRed]best a lance with it[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Of course, there's a downside...
[ToggleRed]Axes can best this sword[ToggleRed].[.][A]
Take this as a gift. It's your reward[.]
for listening to an old man ramble.[.][A]
Don't be so shy. It's not like
I can use the thing.[A]

fought. I trained with many of them...[A]
And yet they attacked us
without hesitation.[.][A]

First, about Marquess Caelin's illness.[.][A]
He really is unwell. He's been abed[.]
for nigh on three months.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][CloseEyes]
Oh, no... Grandfather...[A]
[OpenLeft]
I heard an interesting rumor
about his condition, though.[A]
The people believe that someone's[.]
been poisoning the marquess...[A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveMidRight][OpenEyes]
He's being poisoned!?[.][A]
[OpenLeft]
And this someone...[.][A][.....][ToggleSmile]
Well, everyone's too afraid to
mention a name.[.][A][ToggleSmile]
However, they say that, as soon[.]
as the marquess took ill,[.][A]
a certain noble took control of the[.]
castle as though it were his own.[.][A]
I fed a hungry innkeeper some[.]
coin, and he fed me a name.[.][A][0x02][.....]
The marquess of Caelin's own
brother, Lord Lundgren.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight][MoveRight]
How can this be?[A]
How can they allow him
to get away with this?[A]
The villagers know he's the one[.]
poisoning my grandfather,[.][A]
and yet no one raises a hand
against him? Why?[.][A]
[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x2F][0x01]
They are afraid, and they lack proof.[.][A]
The whisperings of the common[.]
people means nothing.[.][A]
[OpenLeft]
That's the truth of it.[.][A]
And of the marquess's loyal retainers[.]
who might have lent credence to[.][A]
these rumors, there is no sign.[.][A]
[SendToBack][OpenRight]

At least, that's the story Lundgren's[.]
telling to all who'll listen.[.][A]
[SendToBack][OpenRight]
What does that mean?[A][SendToBack]

It means that people are waiting

He can rise [ToggleRed]as high[.]
as level 20[.][ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
Most units can [.][ToggleRed]change
classes[.][ToggleRed] once they
reach [ToggleRed]level 10[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
By changing classes,
units can improve all[.]
of their abilities.[.][A][0x02]
Movement range,[.]
constitution, usable
weapons... Everything.
There are many benefits.[A][0x02]
With a single action,[.]
you can make your[.]
units significantly[.]
more powerful.[A][0x02]
In order to change
classes, units need[.]
to be of a certain level.[.]
However, you also need
a [ToggleRed]special item[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
For example, Wallace is[.]
carrying a [.][ToggleRed]knight crest[ToggleRed].[.]
With this, cavaliers
and knights can change
classes.[A][0x02]
Each character class
has its own unique item[.]
that allows units of that[.]
class to switch to a
different class.[A][0x02]
Well then, why don't we[.]
try changing classes
now?[A][0x02]
Select Wallace, then
choose [.][ToggleRed]knight crest[ToggleRed]
from his [.][ToggleRed]items[.][ToggleRed]
and use it.[.][A][.....][X]

Lundgren, please.[.][A]
It's an energy ring. It'll increase[.]
your strength and magic power a bit.[A]
There are lots of items that
augment your abilities.[.][A]
These are hard to come by, so think[.]
carefully before you use them.[A]
Of course, not using them at all would
be a terrible waste as well, right?[.][A]
Items like this might vanish

Bear that in mind, and use
them wisely.[A][X]

Rain must make it difficult[.]

I used to ride horses when I was
little. Oh, I remember how those[A]
horses disliked the rain.[.][A]
It's better to be on foot[.]
when it's wet.[A]
Nomadic horses are trained on the[.]
plains, so they're better with rain, but...[.][A]
Well, rain just seems to make it
hard for everyone to get around.[A]

You're here to fight Lundgren,
aren't you?[.][A]
Do you have enough weapons?[.][A]
Lundgren's no ordinary knight:
he's a general.[.][A]
Iron weapons lack the edge
to penetrate his armor.[.][A]
If you need something, visit my[.]
father's armory.[A]
You should go to the shop[.]
next door to his, too.[A]
They've many powerful weapons and[.]
items you can use against Lundgren.[.][A]
Head south and cross the river.[.]
You'll see them.[A]
Lundgren's a tricky one.
He's destroyed the bridge.[A]
There's an old snag next to the[.]

Let me give you a brief[.]
explanation of magic.[.][.....]
Magic can be divided into[.]
three large groups.[.][A][0x02]
[ToggleRed]Anima[.][ToggleRed] magic is[.]
based on nature. Its attacks
include Fire and Thunder.[.][A][0x02]
The basic attack of [ToggleRed]Light[.][ToggleRed]
is Lightning,[.][.....] while [.][ToggleRed]Dark[ToggleRed]
magic uses a spell called Flux.[.][A][0x02]
Each type of magic has an[.]
affinity for other types of[.]
magic, similar to the[.]
weapons triangle.[.][A][0x02]
[ToggleRed]Light[.][ToggleRed] is [ToggleRed]strong vs. dark[.][ToggleRed],[.]
[ToggleRed]dark[ToggleRed] is [ToggleRed]strong vs. anima[ToggleRed], and[.]
[ToggleRed]anima[.][ToggleRed] is [ToggleRed]strong vs. light[ToggleRed].[.][.....]
This is the [ToggleRed]Trinity of Magic[ToggleRed].[.][A][0x02]
So, a monk's [.][ToggleRed]light magic[.][ToggleRed] is[.]
[ToggleRed]strong[ToggleRed] against a shaman's[.]
[ToggleRed]dark magic[ToggleRed]. Remember
which class has an advantage
over which other class.[.][A][.....][X]

guild that Erik spoke of.[.][A]

[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]
Explain.[A][SendToBack][X]

# 0x0AFD
[OpenLeft]
The Black Fang is a guild of
assassins founded about ten[.][A]
years ago by Brendan Reed.
They're based in Bern.[A]
Their arms reached quickly
in several other countries.[.][A]
Originally, they targeted only
nobles who abused their positions.[A]
The masses saw them as chivalrous,
defenders of the common man.[A]
Their activities found
wide support.[.][A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft]
Chivalrous...[.][A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]
Then about a year ago, Brendan
got married again.[A]
Black Fang's operations have
slowly changed since then.[A]
Now, they'll take on any
target, no matter how difficult,[A]
as long as they're paid.[A]
And they're no longer killing only
criminals; anyone is a fair target.[.][A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarRight]
Is this Black Fang responsible for
what's happened to my grandfather?[A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]
Yes.[A]
We've learned of a mystery man
named Nergal, behind Reed's wife.[.][A]
It seems the Black Fang is performing[.]
secret tasks across Lycia for Nergal.[.][A]
Nergal's trusted retainer Ephidel[.]
is with Marquess Laus.[A]
He manipulated Laus into hatching[.]
the rebellion plot against Ostia.[.][A]
The first to answer Laus's
call for rebellion was...[.][A]
Marquess Santaruz.[A]

the Dragon's Gate.[A]

Where is that?[A][X]

On an isle called Valor, off

however,[.....] I will go and find him.[A]

Otherwise, they might target
my grandfather again.[.][A][CloseSpeechSlow][.....]

Only then will you be able to[.]
receive the dark and master it.[.][A]
If your disposition is weak,
the dark will overwhelm you.[A]
You will be...lost...[.][A]
...Ofttimes,[A]

That's what Nergal called it.[.][A]
The substance of the human
spirit... Power. Energy.[A]

Neither Ninian nor I
have that power.[A]
Lyn knows. We only have[.]
our special power...[A]
Anyway, Nergal needed to gather[.]
a large amount of quintessence.[.][A]
So he sent his henchman, Ephidel,[.]
to get close to Marquess Laus.[A]
He sought to plant the seeds of[.]
war in Darin's power-hungry heart.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
...To what end?[.][A]
[OpenLeft]
It seems the quintessence in each[.]
person varies in strength.[A]
A person of strong mind and body
has hundreds of times more[A]
energy than the average person.[.][A]
It sounds like there aren't[.]
many people like that, though.[A]
It took too long for Nergal to
find people with enough strength.[.][A]
Although it would take time, Nergal[.]
said the easiest way to get[.][A]
that much quintessence was
by starting a war.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x0D][0x01]

quality with quantity? Is that it?[A][CloseSpeechFast]

He'd taken so much energy from
the knights traveling with Elbert.[A]

[OpenLeft][LoadFace][0x16][0x01]
What do you mean?[.][A]
[SendToBack][OpenRight]
I think I know.[.][A]
Thousands of years ago, man and[.]

Yes, we've all heard the stories
of the Eight Legends.[.][A]
I was raised in Sacae, so I[.]

However, knowledge is not enough
for me to prevent disaster.[.][A]

We've finally arrived.[A]
I can't believe they built a

[OpenFarRight][LoadFace][0x05][0x01]
Bern is the only country
on the continent where[A]
wyverns still fly.[A]
With its wyvern riders,[.][A]
I imagine this castle is the
best-defended anywhere.[.][A]
[SendToBack][OpenRight][LoadFace][0x19][0x01]
I agree. Look at the path[.]
leading up the mountain's face.[.][A]
It would be impossible to scale[.]
that in a direct assault.[.][A][SendToBack]
[OpenLeft]
Defenders positioned higher up
would have a clear advantage.[.][A]
Even the best soldiers would
be taken out with ease.[.][A]
Hm...[.][.....] Look at that. They don't[.]
have any sentries posted.[.][A]
They must have a lot of faith[.]
in their defenses.[A]
[OpenFarRight]
Look at these surroundings![.][A]
They probably make do simply
with patrols within the castle.[.][A][0x02]
The mighty Bern.
I'd not like it as an enemy.[A]
[SendToBack][OpenRight]
And yet, from this impregnable
fortress, a treasure was stolen.[A]
Perhaps the king really is
responsible for all this.[.][A]
It's hard to imagine any thief
cracking Bern's defenses.[.][A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]
You're right.[.][A]
But I can't imagine why the[.]
king would do this.[.][A]
To find the Fire Emblem, we're
going to need clues.[A]

sneaking into the castle?[.][A][SendToBack]

Just now... I warped in,

I was watching you

The most important thing

If that's true, why didn't you just[.]
magic us here in the first place?![A]

Of the eight legends, only
Bramimond and myself remain.[A][0x02]
Your journey here was a bit of

of wielding a legendary item.[.][A]

legends, used to defeat the dragons.[A]

Nergal's power at its roots.[A]

Spectacular?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
There are legendary items buried
throughout the world.[.][A]
But we don't have time to[.]

We've settled on collecting[.]
a sword and an axe.[.][A]
The sword is for Eliwood or Lyn.[.....]

protecting the weapon,[A]
but now, if I'm to gain it, I have to[.]
pass a "negotiation of strength,"[.][A]

The weapon's an axe, so you[.]
have to prove your strength.[A]

[OpenMidRight]
Hey, Graybeard Athos, you sure
this is the right place?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes.[A]
Armads, the legendary weapon
of Durban the berserker,[A]
who took its name as his own.[.]
Armads is here.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
If I've got that, I can help
out Eliwood, can't I?[.][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
This battle axe is so tremendous
that normal men cannot even lift it.[A]

Slow down, you fool!
The spirits of the soldiers[.][A]

[OpenMidRight]
...And if I can get through them,[.]
I can take the axe, right?[A]

There are more of them

You can't do this alone.
You must have help.[.][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Fine with me, but how many
people can come with me?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Too many will simply serve

I first met Nergal some[.]
500 years ago, wandering[A]
the Nabata wasteland.[.][A]
Like me, his only drive was the[.]
search for truth in this world.[.][A][0x02]
We were equals in power and[.]
knowledge, and we became[A]
fast friends.[.][A]
We believed we could solve
the mysteries of the world.[.][A]
We truly believed...[A][X]

# 0x0E2F
[SetName]Lyn[.]
So what happened?[.][A][X]

# 0x0E30
[SetName]Athos[.]
A...disagreement, made at the[.]
height of our quest.[A]
One day, as I charted the[.]
mysteries of Nabata,[A]
I came across the most
amazing village...[A][.....]
It was unbelievable, but in that
place, humans and dragons[.][A]
lived together in cooperation.[A][X]

# 0x0E31
[SetName]Hector
Dragons and humans?[.][A]
Are you telling me they[.]
could live together in peace?[.][A][X]

# 0x0E32

truly did exist.[A][X]

That's...[.]
...amazing.[.][A][X]

# 0x0E34
[SetName]Athos[.]
The dragons that
I beheld there...[.][A][0x02]
They were both similar to[.]
and different from[A]
the dragons I had fought
hundreds of years before.[.][A][X]

# 0x0E36
[SetName]Athos[.]
They had refused to fight[.]
humans in the war, and[A]
instead, they retreated[.]
to this wasteland.[A]
They desired nothing but to[.]
remain hidden from the outside.[.][A]
Nergal and I crafted a barrier
and created an oasis for them.[A]
Upon their invitation, we[.]
lived there with them.[A][0x02]
Our life there...[.][A]
It was calm and satisfying.[.][A]
At some point, the village
became known as Arcadia,[A]
a place of perfect peace
for travelers gone astray.[A][X]

# 0x0E37
[SetName]Eliwood[.]
Arcadia...[A][X]

# 0x0E38
[SetName]Athos[.]
The dragons' libraries were[.]
a dream come true to us.[A]
We studied their language and[.]
history with unbridled passion.[.][A]
A century, then two...
Time passed in an eye's blink.[A]
And yet, slowly, our thoughts[.]
turned down different paths.[A][X]

# 0x0E39
[SetName]Lyn[.]
In what way?[A][X]

# 0x0E3A
[SetName]Athos[.]
I wanted to share the[.]
dragons' wisdom with others.[A]
My hope was for our earthly[.]
paradise to spread outward.[.][A][X]

# 0x0E3B
[SetName]Hector
And Nergal?[.][A][X]

# 0x0E3C
[SetName]Athos[.]
Ah, Nergal... He took the[.]
dragons' knowledge...[.][A]
He learned the art of stealing
the essence from living[.][A]
creatures and turning it
into power.[.][A][X]

# 0x0E3D
[SetName]Athos[.]
...It was terrible.[.][A]
When we discovered what[.]
he was doing, the elders[A]
and I tried to pursuade[.]
him to stop.[A]
But the power bewitched him,
and he was deaf to our pleas.[.][A]
He started with small creatures[.]
and grew ever more confident.[.][A]
Then, he began draining the[.]
quintessence of humans.[.][A]
The villagers and I joined
forces and...defeated him.[A]
Or so we thought, but...[A][X]

# 0x0E3E
[SetName]Eliwood[.]
......[A][X]

# 0x0E3F
[SetName]Athos[.]
After he was banished from
Arcadia, Nergal fled to Bern.[.][A]
He increased his power
slowly to avoid our eye.[A][0x02]
Using quintessence, he made[.]
his "puppets," the morphs.[A][0x02]
They're bewitching in form,[.]
with intellects beyond human.[.][A]
I'm sure you've laid eyes[.]
on them yourselves.[.][A][.....]
Jet black hair, pale complexion,
and blood-red lips...[.][A]

are their glittering gold eyes.[.][A][X]

Yes, I'm sure of it.
They are his morphs...[A]
[OpenFarLeft][LoadFace][0x16][0x01]

Are you saying that he
made them all?[A]
[SendToBack][OpenLeft]
It is an abomination. A crime[.]
against all that is natural.[A]
When Nergal began using morphs
to carry out his plans,[.][A]
his power had grown beyond
our ability to contain him.[.][A]
After humans, his next target[.]
became the essence of dragons.[A]
His next target had to be[.]
Arcadia.[A]
I concealed our paradise behind[.]
a curtain of sandstorms.[A]
I then hid in the underground[.]
ruins and waited for him.[.][A]

What do we have to
do to stop him?[.][A][SendToBack]

Our last hope is the power
of the legendary items.[.][A]

us to gather all of them.[.][A]
I will go to the Shrine of Seals
and tell Bramimond everything.[A]
We must have his power,[.]
no matter the cost.[.][A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarRight]
Then we should go to the
Dragon's Gate ahead of you.[.][A]
[SendToBack][OpenLeft]
What!?[A][SendToBack]
[SendToBack][OpenRight]
That's a good idea.[.][A]
Even though you cannot
harm Nergal himself,[A]
you can certainly do some[.]
damage to his troops.[.][A][SendToBack]
[OpenFarLeft]
If we don't answer Nergal's[.]
invitation soon...[A]
He'll continue to send out
troops after us.[A]

might as well take the fight to him![A]
I won't have Lycia ravaged

Though he often speaks in anger,
we are brothers. We are all we have.[A]

To choose one would mean

himself, whatever his choice.[.][A]
I cannot force him to make

[SetName]Nils
A millennium ago...[.][A]
Man chased dragonkind[.]
from the land, exiled us.[.][A][0x02]
We had no place to go...
not on this world.[A]
So we used the Dragon's Gate
to flee into another world.[.][A][0x02]
When we passed through this[.]
chasm in space and time,[A]
many of us were lost. Still,
we endured the journey.[.][A]
We found humans there, too,[.]
but they were few in number.[A]
We had a few skirmishes, but
at last, we found a home.[.][A][X]

# 0x0E9B
[SetName]Nils
We were stable there,[.]
happy, even.[A]
But some thought back on our
former home, and when we did,[.][A]
his voice reached out to us.[A][0x02]
Ninian was a medium in the
other world, an oracle of sorts.[A]
She sat at the Dragon Shrine.[.][A]
She held much power.[A]
We were in prayer at the
shrine when it happened...[A]
We heard a voice calling to[.]
us from the Dragon's Gate.[A]
It was the voice of an old
friend......[A]
We knew we weren't supposed[.]
to open the gate and return[.][A]
to this world.[A]
We had no idea that the owner[.]
of that voice was Nergal...[.][A][X]

# 0x0E9C

Nergal...[.][A][X]

# 0x0E9D

But something unexpected
happened.[.][A][0x02]
When we opened the Dragon's[.]
Gate and traveled here again,[.][A]
we had lost almost all of[.]
our strength...[.][A]
The quintessence left within
us was less even than that[A]
of an average human.[A][0x02]
In order to sustain ourselves,
in order to breathe the air of[A]
this world, we took human form.[.][A]
We placed our energies within[.]
a dragonstone.[A][0x02]
But our dragonstone was[.]
taken...stolen.[.][A]
Nergal hoped to use it as a[.]
tool to summon other dragons.[.][A][0x02]
...Until we escaped.[A]
We couldn't let our foolishness[.]
condemn our friends.[A][X]

# 0x0E9E

Disguised as a dancer and a[.]
bard, we fled and wandered[A]

I'm so envious.[.][X]

# 0x11B1
[ToggleSmile]I guess it's OK.
That's what I think.[X]

# 0x11B2

you and be the best![X]

# 0x11C4
[ToggleSmile]We're just starting out!
C'mon! We can do it![X]

# 0x11C5
[ToggleSmile]Nicely done. Perhaps
one day, I'll do as well.[.][X]

# 0x11C6
[ToggleSmile]That was well led.
I learned much.[.][X]

# 0x11C7

matured...[X]

tactician, you know.[X]

rely on my lance![.][X]

to have you with us...[X]

[ToggleSmile]Ah...that looks good.[.]
You did well out there.[.][X]

# 0x11D3
[ToggleSmile]Oh! Ah, I bet we can
do better together...[.][X]

marks, aren't they?[.][X]

Everyone has bad days.
We can do better![.][X]

Tactician, you are
better than I'd thought.[X]

# 0x11D9
Useless...[X]

# 0x11DA
[ToggleSmile]Saint Elimine, thank you
for this miracle.[.][X]

# 0x11DB
[ToggleSmile]This seems acceptable,
does it not?[X]

# 0x11DC
I'm sorry. I lacked faith.
I hold the blame.[.][X]

# 0x11DD
[ToggleSmile]Mm... This is the best
outcome, is it not?[.][X]

# 0x11DE
[ToggleSmile]I see. No better than[.]
average, are you?[.][X]

# 0x11DF
You seem to lack even[.]
basic skills.[.][X]

# 0x11E0
[ToggleSmile]Hey, you're[.]
just amazing![.][X]

# 0x11E1
[ToggleSmile]Hm... Well, it's better[.]
than I'd thought.[.][X]

# 0x11E2
[ToggleSmile]Deal with it! We'll run[.]
wild over them next time![.][X]

# 0x11E3
[ToggleSmile]If we had someone of
your skill in Ilia...[.][X]

# 0x11E4
[ToggleSmile]A good strategy.
It reflects well on you.[X]

# 0x11E5
Continue...[.]
Duty calls.[.][X]

# 0x11E6
[ToggleSmile]What a surprise. Are
you a genius?[.][X]

# 0x11E7
[ToggleSmile]You tacticians are
handy to have around![.][X]

# 0x11E8
[ToggleSmile]Do better? It's easy
enough to say, but...[.][X]

# 0x11E9
[ToggleSmile]Battle genius... You're[.]
some kind of genius.[X]

# 0x11EA
[ToggleSmile]These results document
your achievements.[X]

I am impressed.[.][X]

# 0x11ED
[ToggleSmile]Excellent leadership.[.]
I learned much.[.][X]

# 0x11EE
Is this the extent of[.]
Pherae's strength?[X]

# 0x11EF
Thank you for aiding
Lyn with your guidance.[.][X]

# 0x11F0
Now I see it. This is[.]
the strength of tactics.[X]

# 0x11F1
This, too, comes at the[.]
guidance of the land.[.][X]

# 0x11F2
...Well done.[.][X]

# 0x11F3
...Middling is the
word I would choose.[X]

# 0x11F4
......[X]

# 0x11F5
[ToggleSmile]You are the greatest
tactician of this age![X]

# 0x11F6
[ToggleSmile]Nicely done.
I'm proud![X]

# 0x11F7
We've both got some[.]
work to do![.][X]

# 0x11F8
[ToggleSmile]Fighting doesn't get
any better than this![.][X]

# 0x11F9
[ToggleSmile]Hm... It's better than I
expected, isn't it?[.][X]

# 0x11FA
Say, is there...anything
more I can be doing?[X]

# 0x11FB
[ToggleSmile]You must return with
me to Etruria, my friend![.][X]

# 0x11FC
[ToggleSmile]Nicely done. You've[.]
some measure of skill.[X]

# 0x11FD
[ToggleSmile]Perhaps this can serve
as a lesson to us.[X]

# 0x11FE
[ToggleSmile]Oh, that is wonderful![X]

# 0x11FF
[ToggleSmile]Good results! Well,[.]
good enough for me![.][X]

# 0x1200
Is there something
wrong?[X]

# 0x1201
[ToggleSmile]Excellent! Continue to
serve Lord Eliwood well![X]

# 0x1202
[ToggleSmile]Eliwood was right to
place his trust in you.[.][X]

# 0x1203
Make better use of me!
You won't regret it![X]

# 0x1204
[ToggleSmile]Hmph. I fear you may
be my next opponent.[X]

# 0x1205
...Not bad.[.][ToggleSmile]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[.][ToggleMouthMove]...Hmph.[X]

# 0x1206
Could it be? Is my
blade...not worthy?[.][X]

# 0x1207
[ToggleSmile]Wow! Terrific!
The best score![.][X]

# 0x1208
[ToggleSmile]Good marks, aren't
they? Yes, indeed.[X]

# 0x1209
I'm holding you back,[.]
aren't I?[.][X]

# 0x120A
[ToggleSmile]...[.][ToggleSmile]Good, or so I here.[.][X]

# 0x120B
[ToggleSmile]...[.][ToggleSmile]Average at best...[X]

# 0x120C
[ToggleSmile]......[ToggleSmile][X]

# 0x120D
[ToggleSmile]Yippee! That's too good!
You're a genius!![.][X]

# 0x120E
[ToggleSmile]Wow! These are good[.]
results, aren't they?[.][X]

# 0x120F
[ToggleSmile]Oh, my... I'd do better[.]
with a bonus, but...[X]

# 0x1210
[ToggleSmile]...Admirable. So, you[.]
do have some worth.[.][X]

# 0x1211
Hm. You've improved,
haven't you?[X]

# 0x1212
...You're not ready.[X]

# 0x1213
[ToggleSmile]You did great! I think
I'll claim you as my own![.][X]

# 0x1214
[ToggleSmile]That's not too bad.[.]
It's thanks to me, yes?[.][X]

# 0x1215
What's this? I told you[.]
to use me![X]

# 0x1216
Your battle sense is
beyond belief![X]

# 0x1217
You have superior battle
abilities, don't you?[.][X]

# 0x1218
Perhaps you could find
happiness off the field?[X]

# 0x1219
[ToggleSmile]Oh! I weep such tears[.]
of gratitude and joy![.][X]

# 0x121A
[ToggleSmile]Oh, well done!
I am impressed![.][X]

# 0x121B
[ToggleSmile]Better you should[.]
join me in my shop, yes?[X]

you, dragon or human![.][X]

but one more dance.[.][X]

[ToggleSmile]Fantastic!
You must be a genius![.][X]

[ToggleSmile]That's a good score!
